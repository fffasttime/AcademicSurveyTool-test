Title: A Regularizer Approach for RBF Networks Under the Concurrent Weight Failure Situation
Relation: The paper focuses on fault tolerance in neural networks, specifically addressing the impact of weight failures on the performance of radial basis function (RBF) networks.
Suggestion: This paper can be used to understand fault tolerance techniques for neural networks and to compare fault tolerance strategies in deep learning with those in RBF networks.
