Relation: The paper "Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift" discusses a method for normalizing layer inputs in deep neural networks to reduce internal covariate shift, which accelerates the training of deep neural networks. This is relevant to the user's literature review on hardware error fault tolerance for deep learning, as it addresses a technique for improving the training of deep learning models.

Suggestion: This paper can be used to discuss the impact of normalization techniques on the training of deep learning models and how it can contribute to fault tolerance in hardware for deep learning.
