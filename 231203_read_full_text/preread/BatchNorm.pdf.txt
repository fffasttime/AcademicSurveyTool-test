Relation: The paper discusses the use of Batch Normalization to accelerate deep neural network training by addressing internal covariate shift, which indirectly contributes to the stability of deep learning models but does not directly address hardware fault tolerance.

Suggestion: Cite this paper to discuss techniques for stabilizing deep learning training, which could be a complementary approach to hardware error fault tolerance.
