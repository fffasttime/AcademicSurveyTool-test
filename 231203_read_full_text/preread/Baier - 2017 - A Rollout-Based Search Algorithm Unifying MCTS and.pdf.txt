Relation: The paper presents a hybrid search algorithm, MCTS-αβ, that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and minimax search with alpha-beta pruning, aiming to leverage the strengths of both methods in game tree evaluation, which is indirectly related to fault tolerance in deep learning hardware through the optimization of search algorithms.

Suggestion: Cite this paper to discuss the potential of hybrid algorithms in enhancing the robustness and efficiency of deep learning computations by optimizing search and decision-making processes.
