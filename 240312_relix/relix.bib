	abstract = {With the promotion of cloud computing, a large number of hardware and software systems in the cloud bring massive and complex operation and maintenance (O\&M) work. To ensure the O\&M efﬁciency of {IT} infrastructures, it is necessary to implement automatic and reliable scheduling for the directed acyclic graph ({DAG}) workﬂow which is composed of multiple O\&M tasks. Considering the changing status of networks and machines in the cloud and the position constraints that some tasks must be executed on the speciﬁed machines in some O\&M scenarios, we propose a novel workﬂow scheduling approach based on Deep Reinforcement Learning ({DRL}) to minimize the workﬂow execution makespan and implement the fault tolerance with the position constraints of tasks execution. In our proposal, we ﬁrst design a fault-tolerant mechanism according to the reliability requirement and the probability distributions of the machine failure parameters with consideration of different failure rates in the heterogeneous environment. Then, we employ proximal policy optimization ({PPO}) to optimize the task scheduling strategy and ensure the strategy to satisfy the position constraints of tasks execution by action masking in proximal policy optimization. The experimental results show that our proposal can effectively reduce the makespan of the faulttolerant workﬂow on the premise of 99.9\% reliability.},

	abstract = {In recent years, Deep Neural Networks ({DNNs}) have made inroads into a number of applications involving pattern recognition – from facial recognition to self-driving cars. Some of these applications, such as self-driving cars, have real-time requirements, where specialized {DNN} hardware accelerators help meet those requirements. Since {DNN} execution time is dominated by convolution, Multiply-and-Accumulate ({MAC}) units are at the heart of these accelerators. As hardware accelerators push the performance limits with strict power constraints, reliability is often compromised. In particular, power-constrained {DNN} accelerators are more vulnerable to transient and intermittent hardware faults due to particle hits, manufacturing variations, and ﬂuctuations in power supply voltage and temperature. Methods such as hardware replication have been used to deal with these reliability problems in the past. Unfortunately, the duplication approach is untenable in a power constrained environment. This paper introduces a low-cost error-resiliency scheme that targets {MAC} units employed in conventional {DNN} accelerators. We evaluate the reliability improvements from the proposed architecture using a set of 6 {CNNs} over varying bit error rates ({BER}) and demonstrate that our proposed solution can achieve more than 99\% of fault coverage with a 5-bits arithmetic code, complying with the {ASIL}-D level of {ISO}26262 standards with a negligible area and power overhead. Additionally, we evaluate the proposed detection mechanism coupled with a word masking correction scheme, demonstrating no loss of accuracy up to a {BER} of 10−2.},

This work proposes Ranger, a low-cost fault corrector, which directly rectiﬁes the faulty output due to transient faults without re-computation. {DNNs} are inherently resilient to benign faults (which will not cause output corruption), but not to critical faults (which can result in erroneous output). Ranger is an automated transformation to selectively restrict the value ranges in {DNNs}, which reduces the large deviations caused by critical faults and transforms them to benign faults that can be tolerated by the inherent resilience of the {DNNs}. Our evaluation on 8 {DNNs} demonstrates Ranger signiﬁcantly increases the error resilience of the {DNNs} (by 3x to 50x), with no loss in accuracy, and with negligible overheads.},

	abstract = {Deep Neural Networks ({DNNs}) show promising performance in several application domains. Nevertheless, {DNN} results may be incorrect, not only because of the network intrinsic inaccuracy, but also due to faults affecting the hardware. Ensuring the fault tolerance of {DNN} is crucial, but common fault tolerance approaches are not cost-effective, due to the prohibitive overheads for large {DNNs}. This work proposes a comprehensive framework to assess the fault tolerance of {DNN} parameters and costeffectively protect them. As a first step, the proposed framework performs a statistical fault injection. The results are used in the second step with classification-based machine learning methods to obtain a bit-accurate prediction of the criticality of all network parameters. Last, Error Correction Codes ({ECCs}) are selectively inserted to protect only the critical parameters, hence entailing low cost. Thanks to the proposed framework, we explored and protected two Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}), each with four different data encoding. The results show that it is possible to protect the critical network parameters with selective {ECCs} while saving up to 79\% memory w.r.t. conventional {ECC} approaches.},

	abstract = {Digital channelizers ({DCs}) based on the Discrete Fourier Transform ({DFT}) and polyphase filter banks are widely used in on-board processing ({OBP}) platforms to extract narrowband sub-channels from a wideband signal efficiently. In high-capacity communication satellite platforms there are always multiple {DCs} extracting narrowband signals from multiple wideband signals in parallel. Field-programmable gate arrays ({FPGAs}) are a popular option for the implementation of {DCs} due to their parallel computing capabilities and good reconfigurability, but {FPGAs} suffer single-event upsets ({SEUs}) on the space platform. This paper focuses on the efficient protection of parallel {DCs} with enhanced coding techniques. We first prove that a linear relationship between parallel {DCs} can be introduced and maintained among the multiple outputs. However, traditional coding schemes cannot be directly applied for the detection of faulty {DCs} due to the quantization noise introduced by fixed point implementations. To address this issue, we propose an enhanced coding scheme by averaging in the space and time domains to minimize the effect of quantization noise, introducing thresholds and a majority voter to further improve the detection probability. Both theoretical analysis and fault injection experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed protection scheme. Experimental results show that all the {SEUs} that cause an {SNR} lower than 20dB can be detected and recovered, and the resource overheads are about 1.6 times and 1.3 times of that of the unprotected {DCs} for systems with 8 {DCs} and 16 {DCs}, respectively.},

	abstract = {General matrix multiplication ({GEMM}) is common to many scientific and machine-learning applications. Convolution, the dominant computation in Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}), can be formulated as a {GEMM} problem. Due to its widespread use, a new generation of processors features {GEMM} acceleration in hardware. Intel recently announced an Advanced Matrix Multiplication ({AMX}®) instruction set for {GEMM}, which is supported by 1kB {AMX} registers and a Tile Multiplication unit ({TMUL}) for multiplying tiles (sub-matrices) in hardware. Silent Data Corruption ({SDC}) is a well-known problem that occurs when hardware generates corrupt output. Google and Meta recently reported findings of {SDC} in {GEMM} in their data centers. Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance ({ABFT}) is an efficient mechanism for detecting and correcting errors in {GEMM}, but classic {ABFT} solutions are not optimized for hardware acceleration. In this paper, we present a novel {ABFT} implementation directly on hardware. Though the exact implementation of Intel {TMUL} is not known, we propose two different {TMUL} architectures representing two design points in the area-power-performance spectrum and illustrate how {ABFT} can be directly incorporated into the {TMUL} hardware. This approach has two advantages: (i) an error can be concurrently detected at the tile level, which is an improvement over finding such errors only after performing the full matrix multiplication; and (ii) we further demonstrate that performing {ABFT} at the hardware level has no performance impact and only a small area, latency, and power overhead.},

Reliability evaluation usually uses Monte Carlo simulation for reliability index calculation. In this process, load shedding calculation occupies the main computing resources. In response to this problem, this paper designs an improved united convolutional neural network to perform load shedding calculations and proposes a reliability calculation process based on {UCNN}. According to the characteristics of the power system, a data set construction method for reliability evaluation is proposed. By introducing a hierarchical sorting method, it can effectively avoid the low density of the data set and the high time-consuming construction process. At the same time, the random first-threepermutation sampling algorithm and the n-ary index random method broaden the possible states of the data set and reduce the complexity of sampling time, thereby providing effective support for model training. Finally, the reliability of the {IEEE}-{RTS}79 system is evaluated, and the results show that the method proposed in this paper is fast and effective.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks ({DNNs}) have been successfully deployed in widespread domains, including healthcare applications. {DenseNet}201 is a new {DNN} architecture used in healthcare systems (i.e., presence detection of the surgical tool). Specialized accelerators such as {GPUs} have been used to speed up the execution of {DNNs}. Nevertheless, {GPUs} are prone to transient effects and other reliability threats, which can impact {DNN} models’ reliability. Safety-critical systems, such as healthcare applications, must be highly reliable because minor errors might lead to severe injury or death. In this paper, we propose a selective mitigation technique that relies on in-depth analysis. First, we inject the {DenseNet}201 model implemented on a {GPU} via {NVIDIA}’s {SASSIFI} fault injector. Second, we perform a comprehensive analysis from the perspective of kernel and layer to identify the most vulnerable portions of the injected model. Finally, we validate our technique by applying it to the top-vulnerable kernels to selectively protect the only sensitive portions of the model to avoid unnecessary overheads. Our experiments demonstrate that our mitigation technique achieves a signiﬁcant reduction in the percentage of errors that cause malfunction (errors that lead to misclassiﬁcation) from 6.463\% to 0.21\%. Moreover, the performance overhead (the execution time) of our technique is compared with the well-known protection techniques: Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance ({ABFT}), Double Modular Redundancy ({DMR}), and Triple Modular Redundancy ({TMR}). The proposed solution shows only 0.3035\% overhead compared to these techniques while correcting up 84.8\% of the {SDC} errors in {DenseNet}201, remarkably improving the healthcare domain’s model reliability.},

	abstract = {In the last few decades, deep learning ({DL}) has drastically enhanced the state of the art of applications such as computer vision, object detection, and language translation. For their outstanding computational capabilities, {DL} architectures, such as deep neural networks ({DNNs}), have become attractive solutions in safety-critical areas such as avionics, robotics, medical image analysis, and automotive. For this reason, the research community has shown increasing attention to understanding the resilience of {DL} models, which is defined as the capability to tolerate the presence of hardware faults. 
It is commonly argued that {DL} models have inherent fault-tolerant properties due to their distributed and parallel structure and their redundancy due to overprovisioning. Indeed, they can withstand the failure of a limited number of neurons and continue to function properly.
Unfortunately, the choice of hardware on which {DL} applications run has also been shown to have an impact on resilience.2 In other words, {DL} resilience must be assessed by examining the entire system stack (hardware and software), making the overall process more complex and costly. Furthermore, {DL} models are not 100\% accurate, which raises an important issue that needs to be considered when addressing the resilience of these systems. As an example, assume a classifier that, due to a fault, decreases its accuracy to 88\% instead of the original 90\%. Then, can the results be accepted (considering the device slightly degraded) or not? In other words, the metrics used to assess resilience need to be thoughtfully evaluated. Metrics generally vary depending on the specific {DL} model and the task it performs (for example, image classification or segmentation), but they all have in common the goal of measuring the degradation introduced by software or hardware faults. This article presents a systematic survey of existing methodologies developed for the assessment of {DL} resilience. Some of the most representative state-of-the-art academic and industrial works are analyzed and discussed. The article proposes a classification of evaluation techniques according to the level of abstraction and the models being evaluated. Moreover, a further contribution of the article is a comparative table indicating the costs and implementation efforts required to use any of the methodologies presented as well as the main advantages and disadvantages. This latter analysis is intended to highlight their strengths and weaknesses and to guide future research directions.},

In this work we compare the accuracy of {QNNs} during accelerated radiation testing when trained with different methodologies and implemented with a dataﬂow architecture in ﬁeld programmable gate arrays ({FPGA}). The initial experiment shows that {QNNs} trained with a novel methodology, called fault-aware training ({FAT}), which accounts for soft errors during neural network ({NN}) training, makes {QNNs} more resilient to single-event-effects ({SEEs}) in {FPGA}.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks have become a ubiquitous tool for mastering complex classiﬁcation tasks. Current research focuses on the development of power-efﬁcient and fast neural network hardware accelerators for mobile and embedded devices. However, when used in safety-critical applications, for example autonomously operating vehicles, the reliability of such accelerators becomes a further optimization criterion which can stand in contrast to power-efﬁciency and latency. Furthermore, ensuring hardware reliability becomes increasingly challenging for shrinking structure widths and rising power densities in the nanometer semiconductor technology era. One solution to this challenge is the exploitation of fault tolerant parts in deep neural networks. In this paper we propose a new method for predicting the error resilience of neurons in deep neural networks and show that this method signiﬁcantly improves upon existing methods in terms of accuracy as well as interpretability. We evaluate prediction accuracy by simulating hardware faults in networks trained on the {CIFAR}-10 and {ILSVRC} image classiﬁcation benchmarks and protecting neurons according to the resilience estimations. In addition, we demonstrate how our resilience prediction can be used for a ﬂexible trade-off between reliability and efﬁciency in neural network hardware accelerators.},

The time and energy overhead of checkpointing, however, grows with the frequency of checkpointing. Considering the growth of expected error rates, amortizing this overhead becomes especially challenging, as checkpointing frequency tends to increase with increasing error rates. Based on the observation that due to imbalanced technology scaling, recomputing a data value can be more energy efﬁcient than retrieving (i.e., loading) a stored copy, this paper explores how recomputation of data values (which otherwise would be read from a checkpoint from memory or secondary storage) can reduce the machine state to be checkpointed, and thereby, the checkpointing overhead. Even in a relatively small scale system, recomputation-based checkpointing can reduce the storage overhead by up to 23.91\%; time overhead, by 11.92\%; and energy overhead, by 12.53\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks usually possess a high overall resilience against errors in their intermediate computations. However, it has been shown that error resilience is generally not homogeneous within a neural network and some neurons might be very sensitive to faults. Even a single bit-ﬂip fault in one of these critical neuron outputs can result in a large degradation of the ﬁnal network output accuracy, which cannot be tolerated in some safety-critical applications. While critical neuron computations can be protected using error correction techniques, a resilience optimization of the neural network itself is more desirable, since it can reduce the required effort for error correction and fault protection in hardware. In this paper, we develop a novel resilience optimization method for deep neural networks, which builds upon a previously proposed resilience estimation technique. The optimization involves only few steps and can be applied to pre-trained networks. In our experiments, we signiﬁcantly reduce the worst-case failure rates after a bit-ﬂip fault for deep neural networks trained on the {MNIST}, {CIFAR}-10 and {ILSVRC} classiﬁcation benchmarks.},

We consider three algorithms: 1) you only look once; 2) a faster region-based {CNN} (Faster R-{CNN}); and 3) a residual network, exposing live hardware to neutron beams. We complement our beam experiments with fault injection to better characterize fault propagation in {CNNs}. We show that a single fault occurring in a {GPU} tends to propagate to multiple active threads, significantly reducing the reliability of a {CNN}. Moreover, relying on error correcting codes dramatically reduces the number of silent data corruptions ({SDCs}), but does not reduce the number of critical errors (i.e., errors that could potentially impact safety-critical applications). Based on observations on how faults propagate on {GPU} architectures, we propose effective strategies to improve {CNN} reliability. We also consider the beneﬁts of using an algorithm-based fault-tolerance technique for matrix multiplication, which can correct more than 87\% of the critical {SDCs} in a {CNN}, while redesigning maxpool layers of the {CNN} to detect up to 98\% of critical {SDCs}.},

	abstract = {General Matrix Multiplication ({GEMM}) is a crucial algorithm for various applications such as machine learning and scientific computing since an efficient {GEMM} implementation is essential for the performance of these calculations. While researchers often strive for faster performance by using large computing platforms, the increased scale of these systems can raise concerns about hardware and software reliability. In this paper, we present a design of a highperformance {GPU}-based {GEMM} that integrates an algorithm-based fault tolerance scheme that detects and corrects silent data corruptions at computing units on-the-fly. We explore fault-tolerant designs for {GEMM} at the thread, warp, and threadblock levels, and also provide a baseline {GEMM} implementation that is competitive with or faster than the state-of-the-art, closed-source {cuBLAS} {GEMM}. We present a kernel fusion strategy to overlap and mitigate the memory latency due to fault tolerance with the original {GEMM} computation. To support a wide range of input matrix shapes and reduce development costs, we present a template-based approach for automatic code generation for both fault-tolerant and non-fault-tolerant {GEMM} implementations. We evaluate our work on {NVIDIA} Tesla T4 and A100 server {GPUs}. Our experimental results demonstrate that our baseline {GEMM} shows comparable or superior performance compared to the closed-source {cuBLAS}. Compared with the prior state-of-the-art non-fused fault-tolerant {GEMM}, our optimal fused strategy achieves a 39.04\% speedup on average. In addition, our fault-tolerant {GEMM} incurs only a minimal overhead (8.89\% on average) compared to {cuBLAS} even with hundreds of errors injected per minute. For irregularly shaped inputs, the code generator-generated kernels show remarkable speedups of 160\% ∼ 183.5\% and 148.55\% ∼ 165.12\% for fault-tolerant and nonfault-tolerant {GEMMs}, respectively, which outperforms {cuBLAS} by up to 41.40\%.},

While {DNNs}’ precision and performance can vary and are essential, it is also vital to deploy trained models that provide high reliability at low cost. To achieve an unyielding reliability and safety level, it is imperative to provide electronic computing systems with appropriate mechanisms to tackle soft errors. This paper, therefore, investigates the relationship between soft errors and model accuracy. In this regard, an extensive soft error assessment of the {MobileNet} model is conducted considering precision bitwidth variations (2, 4, and 8 bits) running on an Arm Cortex-M processor. In addition, this work promotes the use of a register allocation technique ({RAT}) that allocates the critical {DNN} function/layer to a pool of speciﬁc general-purpose processor registers. Results obtained from more than 4.5 million fault injections show that {RAT} gives the best relative performance, memory utilization, and soft error reliability trade-offs w.r.t. a more traditional replication-based approach. Results also show that the {MobileNet} soft error reliability varies depending on the precision bitwidth of its convolutional layers.},

We propose an adaptive approach to {ABFT} for {NN} inference that exploits untapped opportunities in emerging deployment scenarios. {GPUs} have high compute-to-memory-bandwidth ratios, while {NN} layers have a wide range of arithmetic intensities. This leaves some layers compute bound and others memory-bandwidth bound, but current approaches to {ABFT} do not consider these differences. We first investigate {ABFT} schemes best suited for each of these scenarios. We then propose intensity-guided {ABFT}, an adaptive, arithmetic-intensity-guided approach that selects the most efficient {ABFT} scheme for each {NN} layer. Intensity-guided {ABFT} reduces execution-time overhead by 1.09–5.3× across many {NNs} compared to traditional approaches to {ABFT}.},

	abstract = {This article presents a new design automation method for Fault-Tolerant ({FT}) systems implemented on dynamically reconfigurable Field Programmable Gate Arrays ({FPGAs}). The method aims at minimizing the human interactions needed to incorporate {FT} mechanisms into an existing system. It starts with a source code of an original unhardened circuit. It continues by automated manipulation of the source code, algorithmic strategic selection of suitable {FT} techniques, design space exploration of candidate {FT} implementations, and selection of the resulting implementation. The method also includes efficient evaluation of achieved {FT} parameters performed on the target {HW}. As a novel approach working on the level of {HW} description languages is employed, the code modification is separated, which differentiates our method from others. The case study utilizing this method targets the design of an experimental {FT} dynamic partial reconfiguration controller for an {FPGA}. This controller is helpful for the restoration of faulty components due to a single-event upset on an {FPGA}. We used the method to generate a set of Pareto-optimal controllers concerning the design’s Mean Time to Failure ({MTTF}) parameter, power consumption, and size. Then, the {FT} controller is connected to several benchmark circuits, and the reliability parameters are evaluated at the entire system level. Our results show that by replacing the standard reconfigurable controller with our automatically-designed {FT} controller for one specific benchmark, the design size increased by 20.1\%, and {MTTF} increased by 11.7\%. However, the efficiency is highly dependent on the target system size, {MTTF}, and circuit functionality. We also estimate that a complex system defined by half a million configuration bits would improve {MTTF} by more than 50\%.},

	abstract = {On-orbit object detection has received extensive attention in the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence ({AI}) in space research. Deep-learning-based object-detection algorithms are often computationally intensive and rely on high-performance devices to run. However, those devices usually lack spacequaliﬁed versions, and they can hardly meet the reliability requirement if directly deployed on a satellite platform, due to software errors induced by the space environment. In this paper, we evaluated the impact of space-environment-induced software errors on object-detection algorithms through large-scale fault injection tests. Aside from silent data corruption ({SDC}), we propose an extended criterial {SDC}-0.1 to better quantify the effect of the transient faults on the object-detection algorithms. Considering that a bit-ﬂip error could cause severe detection result corruption in many cases, we propose a novel automated model hardening with reinforcement learning ({AMHR}) framework to solve this problem. {AMHR} searches for error-sensitive kernels in a convolutional neural network ({CNN}) through trial and error with a deep deterministic policy gradient ({DDPG}) agent and has ﬁne-grained modular-level redundancy to increase the fault tolerance of the {CNN}-based object detectors. Compared to other selective hardening methods, {AMHR} achieved the lowest {SDC}-0.1 rates for various detectors and could tremendously improve the mean average precision ({mAP}) of the {SSD} detector by 28.8 in the presence of multiple errors.},

	abstract = {Safety-critical systems are often subjected to transient faults. Since these transient faults may lead to soft errors that cause catastrophic consequences, error-handling must be addressed by design. Full-protection against faults is too costly in terms of resource usage. A common approach to relax the resource demands and limit the impact of errors is to consider (m, k)-constraints, which requires that at least m jobs out of any k consecutive jobs are error-free. To assure (m, k)-compliance, static patterns are widely used to select the job execution modes, i.e., either in an error-free mode at the cost of increased worst-case execution time or in an error-prone mode with the advantage of less execution time. Although static patterns have been shown to be effective in energy-aware designs, resource over-provision is inevitable due to the relatively low rate of error probability. In this work, we propose two dynamic (and adaptive) approaches that allow the scheduler to opportunistically select execution modes based on the error-history of the past jobs and the actual error probability. We ﬁrstly propose a Markov chain based solution if the error-probability is known and static and secondly a reinforcement learning-based approach that can handle unknown error probabilities. Experimental evaluations show that our approaches outperform the state-of-the-art in most of the evaluated cases in terms of average utilization for each task and the overall utilization for multitask systems.},

	abstract = {Deep learning techniques have enjoyed wide adoption in real life, including in various safety-critical embedded applications. While neural network computations require protection against hardware errors, the substantial overheads of conventional error-tolerance techniques limit their use on embedded platforms, which carry out demanding deep neural network computations with limited resources. The utilization of conventional techniques is further constrained in high error rate scenarios, increasingly prevalent under aggressive energy and performance optimizations. To resolve this conundrum, we introduce a novel median feature selection technique to ﬁlter the impact of bit errors prior to the execution of each layer. While our technique can be deemed as a ﬁne-grained modular redundancy scheme, its construction purely out of the inherent redundancy of the network necessitates neither additional parameters nor extra multiply-accumulate operations, squashing the inordinate overheads typically associated with such techniques. Median feature selection can be efﬁciently performed in hardware and seamlessly integrated into embedded deep learning accelerators as a modular plug-in. Deep learning models can be trained with standard tools and techniques to ensure a graceful operational interface with the feature selection stages. The proposed technique allows the system to perform accurately even at high error rates by improving its resilience up to four orders of magnitude, yet incurs negligible 0.19\%–0.48\% area and 0.07\%–0.19\% power overheads for the required operations.},

Compared with other methods for register files, the proposed implementation has advantages in resource consumption by reusing the inherent data cache structure in the processor, only increasing 76\% look-up tables and causing 6.09\% extra delay. Finally, we evaluate the impact on system performance after removing some cachelines from the data cache and get conclusion that this design improves the processor’s fault tolerance with small impact on the original data cache performance.},

	abstract = {Error correcting output codes ({ECOCs}) have been proposed to improve the robustness of deep neural networks ({DNNs}) against hardware defects of {DNN} hardware accelerators. Unfortunately, existing efforts suffer from drawbacks that would greatly impact their practicality: 1) robust accuracy (with defects) improvement at the cost of degraded clean accuracy (without defects); 2) no guarantee on better robust or clean accuracy using stronger {ECOCs}. In this paper, we first shed light on the connection between these drawbacks and error correlation, and then propose a novel comprehensive error decorrelation framework, namely {COLA}. Specifically, we propose to reduce inner layer feature error correlation by 1) adopting a separated architecture, where the last portions of the paths to all output nodes are separated, and 2) orthogonalizing weights in common {DNN} layers so that the intermediate features are orthogonal with each other. We also propose a regularization technique based on total correlation to mitigate overall error correlation at the outputs. The effectiveness of {COLA} is first analyzed theoretically, and then evaluated experimentally, e.g., up to 6.7\% clean accuracy improvement compared with the original {DNNs} and up to 40\% robust accuracy improvement compared to the state-ofthe-art {ECOC}-enhanced {DNNs}.},

In particular, we also target the up-todate powerful object detection machine learning model {YOLOv}4 as a case study. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work in the literature addressing reliability evaluation and enhancement for {YOLOv}4. Based on identifying the set of error-sensitive (critical) memory blocks and protecting only this set, we develop more efficient {ECC} and {TMR} methods. Our {ECC} method does not require any additional memory cost, while the area cost of our {TMR} method can be reduced from 200 \% to only 47.5 \%. The reliability evaluation results show that the Mean Time to Failure ({MTTF}) of the {YOLOv}4 object detection system can be extended by about 12 times by the proposed {ECC} method, while the {TMR} method can even achieve 108 times longer than that of {ECC}.

	abstract = {Deep neural networks ({DNNs}) have emerged as the most effective programming paradigm for computer vision and natural language processing applications. With the rapid development of {DNNs}, efﬁcient hardware architectures for deploying {DNN}-based applications on edge devices have been extensively studied. Emerging nonvolatile memories ({NVMs}), with their better scalability, nonvolatility, and good read performance, are found to be promising candidates for deploying {DNNs}. However, despite the promise, emerging {NVMs} often suffer from reliability issues, such as stuck-at faults, which decrease the chip yield/memory lifetime and severely impact the accuracy of {DNNs}. A stuck-at cell can be read but not reprogrammed, thus, stuck-at faults in {NVMs} may or may not result in errors depending on the data to be stored. By reducing the number of errors caused by stuck-at faults, the reliability of a {DNN}-based system can be enhanced. This article proposes {CRAFT}, i.e., criticality-aware fault-tolerance enhancement techniques to enhance the reliability of {NVM}-based {DNNs} in the presence of stuck-at faults. A data block remapping technique is used to reduce the impact of stuckat faults on {DNNs} accuracy. Additionally, by performing bit-level criticality analysis on various {DNNs}, the critical-bit positions in network parameters that can signiﬁcantly impact the accuracy are identiﬁed. Based on this analysis, we propose an encoding method which effectively swaps the critical bit positions with that of noncritical bits when more errors (due to stuck-at faults) are present in the critical bits. Experiments of {CRAFT} architecture with various {DNN} models indicate that the robustness of a {DNN} against stuck-at faults can be enhanced by up to 105 times on the {CIFAR}-10 dataset and up to 29 times on {ImageNet} dataset with only a minimal amount of storage overhead, i.e., 1.17\%.},

However, resource failure is inevitable, and a challenge to optimize the workflow scheduling is to consider the fault tolerance. Most of previous algorithms are based on failure prediction and fault-tolerant strategies, which can cause the time delay and waste of resources. In this paper, combining the above two methods through a deep reinforcement learning framework, an adaptive fault-tolerant workflow scheduling framework called {RLFTWS} is proposed, aiming to minimize the makespan and resource usage rate. In this framework, the fault-tolerant workflow scheduling is formulated as a markov decision process. Resubmission and replication strategy are as two actions. A heuristic algorithm is designed for the task allocation and execution according to the selected fault-tolerant strategy. And, double deep Q network framework ({DDQN}) is developed to select the fault-tolerant strategy adaptively for each task under the current environment state, which is not only prediction but also learning in the process of interacting with the environment. Simulation results show that the proposed {RLFTWS} can efficiently balance the makespan and resource usage rate, and achieve fault tolerance.},

In this article, we consider the problem of implementing {FIR} filters using the stochastic approach. Novel stochastic {FIR} filter designs based on multiplexers are proposed and compared to conventional binary designs implemented using Synopsys tools with a 28-nm cell library. Silicon area, power and maximum clock frequency are obtained to evaluate the throughput per area ({TPA}) and the energy per operation ({EPO}). For equivalent filtering performance, the stochastic {FIR} filters underperform in terms of {TPA} and {EPO} compared to the conventional binary design, although the stochastic design shows more graceful degradation in performance with a significant reduction in energy consumption. A detailed analysis is performed to evaluate the accuracy of stochastic {FIR} filters and to determine the required stochastic sequence length. The fault-tolerance of the stochastic design is compared with that of the binary circuit enhanced with triple modular redundancy ({TMR}). The stochastic designs are more reliable than the conventional binary design and its {TMR} implementation with unreliable voters, but they are less reliable than the binary {TMR} implementation when the voters are fault-free.},

Conventional techniques for error localization incur high-test efforts, without regards to the unique challenges posed by {DL} systems. In this direction, we propose {DiagNNose}, a two-tier machine learning-based error localization framework for on-line fault management in {DL} accelerators. We develop a novel diagnostic pattern selection algorithm to obtain a minimal subset of functional test patterns, that are executed in the accelerator in mission mode. By extracting and analyzing dataﬂow-based features from the intermediate computations of the general matrix multiply ({GEMM}) core, a lightweight multilayer perceptron accomplishes bit-level error localization in 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit datapath units with high ﬁdelity. We have limited ourselves to a single accelerator design, i.e., the versatile tensor accelerator ({VTA}) architecture to evaluate our proposed {DiagNNose} framework. On executing state-of-the-art deep neural networks trained on {ImageNet}; error localization using only 30 diagnostic functional test patterns demonstrate up to 98.4\% diagnosability, thereby demonstrating an improvement of 54.63\% over a random test pattern set, with as low as 4.95\% overhead in the {DL} accelerator in mission mode.},

	abstract = {{BCube} is a promising structure of data center network, as it can signiﬁcantly improve the performance of typical applications. With the expansion of network scale and increasement of complexity, reliability and stability of networks have become more essential. In this paper, we study the fault-tolerant routings in {BCube}. First, we design a fault-tolerant routing algorithm based on node disjoint multi-paths. The proposed multi-path routing has stronger fault tolerance, since each path has no other common nodes except the source node and the destination node. Second, we investigate an effective fault-tolerant routing based on routing capabilities algorithm for {BCube}. The proposed algorithm has higher fault tolerance and success rate of ﬁnding feasible routes, since it does not limit the faults number. Third, we present an adaptive path ﬁnding algorithm for establishing virtual links between any two nodes in {BCube}, which can shorten the diameter of {BCube}. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed routing scheme outperforms the existing popular algorithms. Compared with the state-of-the-art fault-tolerant routing algorithms, the proposed algorithm has a 21.5\% to 25.3\% improvement on both throughput and packet arrival rate. Meanwhile, it reduces the average latency of 18.6\% and the maximum latency of 23.7\% in networks.},

In this paper, a novel active faulttolerant control strategy based on double neural networks combined with improved fast inte­ gral terminal sliding mode control is proposed. The faults only related to the system states are considered, which is very common in electromechanical system. Considering their strong approximation ability, two neural networks with different inputs are added in a high-gain observer to estimate system model uncertainties and fault respectively. Thus, the fault detec­ tion observer can be sensitive to faults without false alarm. An integral term of position error is introduced into a fast terminal sliding surface to design an improved controller. Model un­ certainties and fault are compensated for in the controller with feedforward cancellation tech­ nique based on neural networks’ estimation. The Lyapunov stability theory can guarantee the bounded stability of the proposed control strategy. Extensive comparative simulations and experimental results are obtained to verify the better performance of the proposed control strategy compared with some other traditional fault tolerant strategy.},

This paper presents a novel layered modeling architecture that combines reactive and proactive fault modeling theories to enable reliable, survivable cloud-based applications by addressing fault tolerance concerns. This paper examines the issues of dynamic fault tolerance management and virtual machine ({VM}) migration in cloud data centers. We introduce a comprehensive algorithm that efficiently manages fault tolerance through proactive measures by leveraging a layered modeling architecture. The algorithm considers defect prediction and resource allocation techniques to minimize service interruptions and maximize resource utilization. It incorporates reactive and proactive fault modeling to identify and respond to faults, anticipates potential faults, and takes preventative measures. This integration makes the cloud computing environment more robust and reliable. However, extensive simulations and evaluations demonstrate the proposed algorithm's effectiveness in reducing service downtime, ensuring application reliability, and sustaining optimal performance. The algorithm's ability to dynamically migrate virtual machines ({VMs}) based on defect prediction contributes to efficient resource allocation and load balancing, mitigating potential bottlenecks and enhancing system resilience. The results demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed framework for maintaining cloud-based applications' dependability.

In many cases, researchers use fault injection techniques that are less observable and less controllable to verify system reliability, and at this point, analysing where soft errors occur requires considerable work. In this paper, we present {EBSCN}, an error backtracking method. The {EBSCN} method sorts functions by suspiciousness by analysing the erroneous output results, which will help researchers reduce the amount of work required for analysis. The {EBSCN} method includes a feature extraction method based on clustering and a feature analysis method based on a deep neural network. This paper introduces the principle of the two methods as well as methods to improve and extend them with program-related information. We discuss the effect of the scale of the output result and the severity of the error on the {EBSCN} method through experiments and verify the effect of the {EBSCN} method. The results showed that the proportion of the function in which the soft error actually occurs in the ranking of the top 25\% of the suspiciousness sequence is no less than 82\%, and the proportion ranked in the top 50\% is no less than 97\%.},

	abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}) and Graphic Processing Units ({GPUs}) are now increasingly adopted in many cutting edge safety-critical applications. Consequently, it is crucial to evaluate the reliability of these systems, since the hardware can be affected by several phenomena (e.g., wear out of the device), producing permanent defects in the {GPU}. These defects may induce wrong outcomes in the {CNN} that may endanger the application. Traditionally, the study of the effects of permanent faults on {CNNs} has been approached by resorting to application-level fault injection (e.g., acting on the weights). However, this approach has restricted scope, and it may not reveal the actual vulnerabilities in the {GPU} device. Hence, a more accurate evaluation of the fault effects is required, considering more in-depth details of the device’s hardware. This work introduces a more elaborated experimental evaluation of the impact of {GPU}’s permanent faults on the reliability of a {CNN} by resorting to a Software-Implemented Fault Injection ({SWIFI}) strategy, considering faults at the hardware level. The results of the fault simulation campaigns we performed on the {GPU} data-path cores are compared with those at the application level, proving that the latter ones are generally optimistic.},

	abstract = {The ability of resistive memory ({ReRAM}) to naturally conduct vector–matrix multiplication ({VMM}), which is the primary operation carried out during the training and inference of neural networks, has caught the interest of researchers. The memristor crossbar is one of the desirable architectures to perform {VMM} because it offers various benefits over other memory technologies, including in-memory computing, low power, and high density. Direct downloading and chip-on-the-loop approaches are typically used to train {ReRAM}-based neural networks. In these methods, all weight computations are carried out by a host machine, and the computed weights are downloaded in the crossbar. It has been seen that the network does not deliver the same precision as promised by the host system once the weights have been downloaded. This is because crossbars contain a significant number of faulty memristors and suffer from cell resistance variations because of immature manufacturing technologies. As a result, a cell may not be able to take the exact weight values that the host system generates, and may lead to incorrect inferences. Existing techniques for fault-tolerant mapping either involve network retraining or employ a graph-matching strategy that comes with hardware, power, and latency overheads. In this paper, we propose a mapping method to tolerate the effect of defective memristors. In order to lessen the impact of faulty memristors, the mapping is done in a way that allows network weights to cover up faulty memristors. Further, this work prioritizes the different faults based on the frequency of occurrence. The mapping efficiency is found to increase significantly with low power, area and latency overheads in the proposed approach. Experimental analyses show considerable improvement as compared to state-of-the-art works.},

In fact, linear algebra tools permeate a wide variety of applications: from weather forecasting, to ﬁnancial market prediction, radio signal processing, computer vision, and more. Since many of the aforementioned applications typically impose strict performance and/or fault tolerance constraints, the demand for fast and reliable matrix multiplication ({MxM}) is at an all-time high. Typically, increased reliability is achieved through redundancy. However, coarse-grain duplication incurs an often prohibitive overhead, higher than 100\%. Thanks to the peculiar characteristics of the {MxM} algorithm, more efﬁcient algorithmbased hardening solutions have been designed to detect (and even correct) some types of errors with lower overhead. We show that, despite being more efﬁcient, current solutions are still sub-optimal in certain scenarios, particularly when considering persistent faults in Field-Programmable Gate-Arrays ({FPGAs}). Based on a thorough analysis of the fault model, we propose an error detection technique for {MxM} that decreases both algorithmic and architectural costs by over a polynomial degree, when compared to existing algorithm-based strategies. Furthermore, we report arithmetic overheads at the application level to be under 1\% for three state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}).},

Compared to conventional repetition coding, the proposed {RC}-{DL} exploits {FP}32 non-uniform magnitude encoding by increasing the repeat rates to protect sensitive bit positions and reduce the repeat rates to insensitive bit positions. Hence, {RC}-{DL} uses a number of bits equivalent to a 3-bit repetition code while delivering the performance close to 11-bit repetition code. We perform extensive Monte Carlo simulations to simulate the write-error property with {ImageNet} 2012 pretrained models. The {DNN} models with {RC}-{DL} are shown to be operable in the extremely imperfect environment while delivering with only minor reductions in {DNN} performance.},

	abstract = {Aggressive voltage scaling to reduce energy consumption in Multicore causes exponential cell failures in {SRAM}. Last-level-cache ({LLC}), the major contender of chip area, exhibits highest sensitivity to low voltage parametric failures and limits energy efficiency. To break the energy barrier, exclusive fault protection mechanism is solicited to ensure on-chip data recovery out of the low voltage failures. This work proposes Cache evolution for energy efficiency by protecting cache blocks from {SRAM} cell failures due to voltage scaling. A set of coherence and reuse aware in-cache selective replication policies are proposed to ensure on-chip data recovery. Reuse likelihood is predicted through a vector optimization technique using Genetic Algorithm ({GA}). Reuse aware selective invalidation is employed to balance cache load due to replications. A replication aware replacement policy is also developed that victimizes the lowest reusable cache block. The proposed scheme is evaluated in Multi2Sim 5.0 simulation framework with {SPEC} {CPU} benchmark programs. Experimental results claim 43.66\% and 38.80\% reductions in miss rate and 59.10\% and 52.73\% reductions in vulnerability for integer and floating point benchmarks respectively. Energy reduction of 39.21\% is observed for integer and 25.73\% is observed for floating point benchmarks. Up to 34.78\% and 26.98\% power reductions in integer and floating point benchmarks are also observed.

	abstract = {Modern large-scale service systems are usually deployed with redundant components to ensure high dependability in distributed and volatile environments. Fault Injection Testing ({FIT}) is a popular technique for testing such systems, while the application of {FIT} to validating the correctness of redundant components remains a challenging task, especially when the system’s structural information is unavailable when testing starts. In this study, we refer to a minimum set of faults that, when injected, will cut off all execution paths in a service system as a fault-tolerance bottleneck, and we propose a novel Fault-tolerance Bottleneck driven Fault Injection ({FBFI}) approach to the exploration and validation of redundant components without prior knowledge of the system’s business structure. The core idea of {FBFI} is to iteratively infer and inject bottlenecks of the business structure constructed so far. In this way, {FBFI} is able to discover and test redundant components by repeatedly triggering new system behaviors. The effectiveness and efﬁciency of {FBFI} is evaluated using two microservice benchmark systems with different deployment scales. The results reveal that {FBFI} is more practical and cost-effective than random and lineage-driven {FIT} approaches in testing service systems of high redundancy levels.},

Approximate error mitigation techniques are an attractive solution to reduce the overheads caused by conventional approaches, such as Triple Modular Redundancy. These techniques use approximate redundant copies of the target design which can be implemented with less resources, at the expense of slightly reducing the precision of the result in case of error. In this work, we propose Optimized Redundancy for Composite Algorithms ({ORCA}), a novel hardening technique for algorithms that may be decomposed into more simple parts. Instead of adding identical redundant modules, we use complementary modules that can be composed to implement the target design. These complementary modules can also be compared to detect errors. However, when they are correct, they produce an exact result instead of an approximate result. The experimental results show that this technique can reduce the overhead and provide a better trade-off between overhead and precision than existing approximate techniques.},

The complexity, speed and low-power operation of the underlying hardware makes them vulnerable to soft errors that corrupt the results of computations and memory accesses. Existing approaches to error resilience are either expensive in terms of overhead, require {DNN} re-training or applicable to only specific hardware domains. In contrast, we present a novel error resilience approach that does not require {DNN} re-training and scales across computation as well as weight parameter errors. In the proposed methodology, the statistics of gradients of neuron output values relative to adjacent neurons in an ordering of neurons allow tight theoretically grounded thresholding of neuron outputs to diagnose erroneous neuron outputs. These are then set to zero (suppressed) for error resilience. A low overhead error diagnosis module is used for this purpose and is designed using gradient statistics collected across the training dataset of the {DNN}. Our approach is compared against state of the art error resilience techniques and validated on multiple datasets, networks and error scenarios as well a hardware test case.},

In particular, Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}) are commonly deployed in autonomous driving applications to fulﬁl complex tasks such as object recognition and image classiﬁcation. Ensuring the reliability of {CNNs} is thus becoming an urgent requirement since they constantly behave in human environments. A common and recent trend is to replace the full-precision {CNNs} to make way for more optimized models exploiting approximation paradigms such as reduced bit-width data type. If from one hand this is poised to become a sound solution for reducing the memory footprint as well as the computing requirements, it may negatively affect the {CNNs} resilience. The intent of this work is to assess the reliability of a {CNN}-based system when reduced bit-widths are used for the network parameters (i.e., synaptic weights). The approach evaluates the impact of permanent faults in {CNNs} by adopting several bit-width schemes and data types, i.e., ﬂoating-point and ﬁxed-point. This determines the trade-off between the {CNN} accuracy and the bits required to represent network weights. The characterization is performed through a fault injection environment built on the darknet open source framework. Experimental results show the effects of permanent fault injections on the weights of {LeNet}-5 {CNN}.},

However, further research is needed to gain a better understanding of the accuracy of the results and the feasibility of their application under realistic radiation conditions. In this article, an understanding of scenarios in which Instruction Set Architecture simulators or emulators may be relied upon for realistic statistical fault injection campaigns is advanced. An analysis is presented of the results from two simulation-based fault injection tools versus a set of fault emulation results on a real processor. The conclusions of the analysis assist the selection of the most efficient tool and method for testing many different software-based fault mitigation techniques within reasonable time periods and at affordable costs throughout an irradiation campaign. In particular, it was established that a partially ordered set of relations could be defined on the basis of statistical fault injection in relation to the effects of different versions of an application and a given simulator that remained unaltered during the irradiation experiments.

Due to the computational capacity enhancements provided by {COTS} technology, machine-learning and computervision applications are now being deployed on modern space missions. However, {COTS} electronics are highly susceptible to radiation environments. As a result, reliability in the underlying computations becomes a concern. Matrix multiplication is used in machine-learning and computer-vision applications as the main computation for decisions, making it a critical part of the application.

However, small accuracy variations may increase the sensitivity of these accelerators toward undesired subtle disturbances, such as permanent faults. The impact of permanent faults in accurate deep neural network ({AccDNN}) accelerators has been thoroughly investigated in the literature. Conversely, the impact of permanent faults and their mitigation in approximate {DNN} ({AxDNN}) accelerators is vastly underexplored. Toward this, we first present an extensive fault resilience analysis of approximate multilayer perceptrons ({MLPs}) and convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) using the state-of-the-art Evoapprox8b multipliers in graphic processing unit ({GPU}) and tensor processing unit ({TPU}) accelerators. Then, we propose a novel fault mitigation method, i.e., fault-aware retuning of weights (Fal-{reTune}). Fal-{reTune} retunes the weights using a weight mapping function in the presence of faults for improved classification accuracy. To evaluate the fault resilience and the effectiveness of our proposed mitigation method, we used the most widely used {MNIST}, Fashion-{MNIST}, and {CIFAR}10 datasets. Our results demonstrate that the permanent faults exacerbate the accuracy loss in {AxDNNs} compared with the {AccDNN} accelerators. For instance, a permanent fault in {AxDNNs} can lead to 56\% accuracy loss, whereas the same faulty bit can lead to only 4\% accuracy loss in {AccDNN} accelerators. We empirically show that our proposed Fal-{reTune} mitigation method improves the performance of {AxDNNs} up to 98\%, even with fault rates up to 50\%. Furthermore, we observe that the fault resilience in {AxDNNs} is orthogonal to their energy efficiency.},

	abstract = {The increase in machine size and the decrease in operating voltage have made errors more common, both soft (bit ﬂip) and hard (component failure). Checkpointrestart solutions address the problem of hard errors, but incur signiﬁcant costs in time and hardware. For some algorithms, classical matrix multiplication included, tailored solutions incur much lower overhead. Existing eﬃcient algorithmic tolerance techniques typically aim for iterative algorithms, and thus cannot be applied to recursive algorithms, such as fast matrix multiplication algorithms. By utilizing combinatorial aspects of the computational graphs of these algorithms, we obtain fault resilience with small overhead costs, for Strassen’s and other recursive fast matrix multiplication algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst faulttolerant solution tailored for fast matrix multiplication algorithm. Our solution is asymptotically better than any of the previous (classical based) fault-tolerant solutions, unless the error rate is extremely high. Our technique can be used to obtain fault tolerance for other recursive algorithms. In addition, we show how to reduce communication costs using additional processors, and discuss inherent fault tolerance capabilities of fast matrix multiplication algorithms.},

	abstract = {Current algorithm-based fault tolerance ({ABFT}) approach for one-sided matrix decomposition on heterogeneous systems with {GPUs} have following limitations: (1) they do not provide sufﬁcient protection as most of them only maintain checksum in one dimension; (2) their checking scheme is not efﬁcient due to redundant checksum veriﬁcations; (3) they fail to protect {PCIe} communication; and (4) the checksum calculation based on a special type of matrix multiplication is far from efﬁcient. By overcoming the above limitations, we design an efﬁcient {ABFT} approach providing stronger protection for onesided matrix decomposition methods on heterogeneous systems. First, we provide full matrix protection by using checksums in two dimensions. Second, our checking scheme is more efﬁcient by prioritizing the checksum veriﬁcation according to the sensitivity of matrix operations to soft errors. Third, we protect {PCIe} communication by reordering checksum veriﬁcations and decomposition steps. Fourth, we accelerate the checksum calculation by 1.7x via better utilizing {GPUs}.},

	abstract = {In large-scale parallel computing systems, machines and the network suffer from non-negligible faults, often leading to system crashes. The traditional method to increase reliability is to restart the failed jobs. To avoid unnecessary time wasted on reboots, we propose an optimal scheduling strategy to enable fault-tolerant reliable computation to protect the integrity of computation. Specifically, we determine the optimal redundancy-failure rate tradeoff to incorporate redundancy into parallel computing units running multiple-precision arithmetics, like the Chinese Remainder Theorem, that are useful for applications such as asymmetric cryptography and fast integer multiplication. Inspired by network coding in distributed storage for disk failures, we propose coding matrices to strategically map partial computation to available computing units, so that the central unit can reliably reconstruct the results of any failed machine without recalculations to yield the final correct computation output. We propose optimization-based algorithms to efficiently construct the optimal coding matrices subject to fault tolerance specifications. Performance evaluation demonstrates that the optimal scheduling effectively reduces the overall running time of parallel computing while resisting wide-ranging failure rates.},

	abstract = {We introduce a framework for fault-tolerant postselection ({FTPS}) of fault-tolerant codes and channels—such as those based on surface codes—using soft-information metrics based on visible syndrome and erasure information. We introduce several metrics for ranking configurations of syndromes and erasures. In particular, we introduce the logical gap (and variants thereof) as a powerful soft-information metric for predicting logical error rates of fault-tolerant channels based on topological error-correcting codes. The logical gap is roughly the unsigned weight difference between inequivalent logical corrections and is adaptable to any tailored noise model or decoder. We deploy this framework to prepare high-quality surface-code magic states with low overhead under a model of independent and identically distributed ({IID}) Pauli and erasure errors. Postselection strategies based on the logical gap can suppress the encoding error rate ({EER}) of a magic state preparation channel to the level of the physical error rate with low overhead. For example, when operating at 60\% of the bulk threshold of the corresponding surface code, an overall reduction of the {EER} by a factor of 15 is achievable with a relative overhead factor of {\textless} 2 (approximately 23 times less than that of simple syndrome-counting rules). We analyze a schematic buffer architecture for implementing postselection rules on magic state factories in the context of magic state distillation. The {FTPS} framework can be utilized for mitigating errors in more general fault-tolerant logical channels.},

	abstract = {Neuromorphic computing uses spiking neuron network models to solve machine learning problems in a more energy-efficient way when compared to conventional artificial neural networks. However, mapping the various network components to the neuromorphic hardware is not trivial to realize the desired model for an actual simulation. Moreover, neurons and synapses could be affected by noise due to external interference or random actions of other components (i.e., neurons), which eventually lead to unreliable results. This work proposes a fault-tolerant spiking neural network mapping algorithm and architecture to a 3D network-on-chip ({NoC})-based neuromorphic system (R-{NASH}-{II}) based on a rank and selection mapping mechanism ({RSM}). The {RSM} allows the ranking and rapid selection of neurons for fault-tolerant mapping. Evaluation results show that with our proposed mechanism, we could maintain a mapping efficiency of 100\% with 20\% spare rate and a fault rate (40\%) more than in the previous mapping framework. The Monte Carlo simulation evaluation of reliability shows that the {RSM} mechanism has increased the mean time to failure ({MTTF}) of the previous mapping technique by 43\% on average. Furthermore, the operational availability of the {RSM} for mapping to a 4 × 4 × 4 (smallest) and 6 × 6 × 6 (largest) {NoC} is 88\% and 67\% respectively.},

At the algorithmic level, we propose a hybrid strategy to incorporate fault-tolerant functionality. For memory-bound Level1 and Level-2 {BLAS} routines, we duplicate computing instructions and re-use data at the register level to avoid memory overhead when validating the runtime correctness. Here we novelly propose to utilize mask registers on {AVX}512-enabled processors and {SIMD} registers on {AVX}2-enabled processors to store intermediate comparison results. For compute-bound Level-3 {BLAS} routines, we fuse memory-intensive operations such as checksum encoding and veriﬁcation into the {GEMM} assembly kernels to optimize the memory footprint. We also design cache-friendly parallel algorithms for our fault-tolerant library. Through a series of architectural-aware optimizations, we manage to maintain the fault-tolerant overhead at a negligible order ({\textless}3\%). Experimental results obtained on widely-used processors such as Intel Skylake, Intel Cascade Lake, and {AMD} Zen2 demonstrate that {FT}-{BLAS} offers high reliability and high performance – faster than Intel {MKL}, {OpenBLAS}, and {BLIS} by up to 3.50\%, 22.14\%, and 21.70\%, respectively, for both serial and parallel routines spanning all three levels of {BLAS} we benchmarked, even under hundreds of errors injected per minute.},

Inherently, they are considered to be highly error-tolerant. However, recent studies have shown that hardware faults that impact the parameters of a {DNN} (e.g., weights) can have drastic impacts on its classiﬁcation accuracy. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive error resilience analysis of {DNNs} subjected to hardware faults (e.g., permanent faults) in the weight memory. The outcome of this analysis is leveraged to propose a novel error mitigation technique which squashes the highintensity faulty activation values to alleviate their impact. We achieve this by replacing the unbounded activation functions with their clipped versions. We also present a method to systematically deﬁne the clipping values of the activation functions that result in increased resilience of the networks against faults. We evaluate our technique on the {AlexNet} and the {VGG}-16 {DNNs} trained for the {CIFAR}-10 dataset. The experimental results show that our mitigation technique signiﬁcantly improves the resilience of the {DNNs} to faults. For example, the proposed technique offers on average 68.92\% improvement in the classiﬁcation accuracy of resilience-optimized {VGG}-16 model at 1 × 10−5 fault rate, when compared to the base network without any fault mitigation.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a fault-tolerant {ALU} (“{FT}-{EALU}”) based on time redundancy and reward/punishment-based learning approaches for real-time embedded systems that face limitations in hardware and power consumption budgets. In this method, operations are diversified to three versions in order to correct permanent faults along with the transient ones. The diversities of versions considered in {FT}-{EALU} are provided by lightweight modifications to differentiate them and clear the effect of permanent faults. Selecting lightweight modifications such as shift and swap would avoid high timing overhead in computation while providing significant differences which are necessary for fault detection. Next, the replicated versions are executed serially in time, and their corresponding results are voted based on the derived learned weights. The proposed weighted voting module generates the final output based on the results and their weights. In the proposed weighted voting module, a reward/punishment strategy is employed to provide the weight of each version of execution indicating its effectiveness in the final output. To this aim, in the method defined for each version of execution, a weight is defined according to its correction capability confronting several faulty scenarios. Thus, this weight defines the reliability of the temporal results as well as their effect on the final result. The final result is generated bit by bit based on the weight of each version of execution and its computed result. Based on the proposed learning scheme, positive or negative weights are assigned to execution versions. These weights are derived in bit level based on the capability of execution versions in mitigating permanent faults in several fault injection scenarios. Thus, our proposed method is low cost and more efficient compared to related research which are mainly based on information and hardware redundancy due to employing time redundancy and static learning approach in correcting permanent faults. Several experiments are performed to reveal the efficiency of our proposed approach based on which {FT}-{EALU} is capable of correcting about 84.93\% and 69.71\% of permanent injected faults on single and double bits of input data.},

We design a cache-friendly scheme for parallel {FT}-{GEMM}. Experimental results on Intel Cascade Lake demonstrate that {FT}-{GEMM} offers high reliability and performance – faster than Intel {MKL}, {OpenBLAS}, and {BLIS} by 3.50\%∼ 22.14\% for both serial and parallel {GEMM}, even under hundreds of errors injected per minute.},

Task redundancy is one commonly employed technique to enhance control performance in applications afflicted by intermittent faults. While increasing the number of replicas can improve control performance, it also introduces challenges in terms of scheduling and mapping. Prior research primarily focuses on controller design to enhance control performance, with limited consideration given to fault tolerance and scheduling in a combined manner. In this paper, we propose a co-design scheme of Fault-Tolerant Scheduling and Control ({FTSC}), which aims to provide stable control performance along with feasible mapping and scheduling solutions. We present a comprehensive formulation that encompasses mapping, scheduling, and fault tolerance, optimizing control performance into a Mixed Integer Linear Programming ({MILP}) framework. The problem of task redundancy can either be addressed through a heuristic algorithm efficiently or be solved in a {MILP}-based approach with a better solution. A case study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme, highlighting its ability to reduce system control costs while meeting real-time, reliability, and schedulability constraints.},

However, {nZDC} control-flow checking mechanism is architecture-dependent and suffers from some vulnerability holes. In this work, we address these issues by substituting {nZDC} control-flow checking mechanism with a general ({ISA}-independent) scheme and propose two transformations, coarse-grained scheduling and asymmetric control-flow signatures, for hard-to-detect control flow errors. Fault injection experiments on different hardware components of synthesizable Verilog description of an {OpenRISC}-based microprocessor reveal that the proposed transformation shows 85\% less silent data corruptions compared to {nZDC}.

Transient hardware errors may percolate undesirable state during execution, resulting in software-manifested errors which can adversely affect high-level decision making. This paper presents {HarDNN}, a software-directed approach to identify vulnerable computations during a {CNN} inference and selectively protect them based on their propensity towards corrupting the inference output in the presence of a hardware error. We show that {HarDNN} can accurately estimate relative vulnerability of a feature map (fmap) in {CNNs} using a statistical error injection campaign, and explore heuristics for fast vulnerability assessment. Based on these results, we analyze the tradeoff between error coverage and computational overhead that the system designers can use to employ selective protection. Results show that the improvement in resilience for the added computation is superlinear with {HarDNN}. For example, {HarDNN} improves {SqueezeNet}’s resilience by 10× with just 30\% additional computations.},

Nevertheless, {DNN} results may be incorrect, not only because of the network intrinsic inaccuracy, but also due to faults affecting the hardware. Indeed, hardware faults may impact the {DNN} inference process and lead to prediction failures. Therefore, ensuring the fault tolerance of {DNN} is crucial. However, common fault tolerance approaches are not cost-effective for {DNNs} protection, because of the prohibitive overheads due to the large size of {DNNs} and of the required memory for parameter storage. In this work, we propose a comprehensive framework to assess the fault tolerance of {DNNs} and cost-effectively protect them. As a first step, the proposed framework performs datatype-and-layer-based fault injection, driven by the {DNN} characteristics. As a second step, it uses classification-based machine learning methods in order to predict the criticality, not only of network parameters, but also of their bits. Last, dedicated Error Correction Codes ({ECCs}) are selectively inserted to protect the critical parameters and bits, hence protecting the {DNNs} with low cost. Thanks to the proposed framework, we explored and protected two Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}), each with four different data encoding. The results show that it is possible to protect the critical network parameters with selective {ECCs} while saving up to 83\% memory w.r.t. conventional {ECC} approaches.},

	abstract = {Space Cyber-Physical Systems (S-{CPS}) such as spacecraft and satellites strongly rely on the reliability of onboard computers to guarantee the success of their missions. Relying solely on radiation-hardened technologies is extremely expensive, and developing inflexible architectural and microarchitectural modifications to introduce modular redundancy within a system leads to significant area increase and performance degradation. To mitigate the overheads of traditional radiation hardening and modular redundancy approaches, we present a novel Hybrid Modular Redundancy ({HMR}) approach, a redundancy scheme that features a cluster of {RISC}-V processors with a flexible on-demand dual-core and triple-core lockstep grouping of computing cores with runtime split-lock capabilities. Further, we propose two recovery approaches, software-based and hardware-based, trading off performance and area overhead. Running at 430 {MHz}, our fault-tolerant cluster achieves up to 1160 {MOPS} on a matrix multiplication benchmark when configured in non-redundant mode and 617 and 414 {MOPS} in dual and triple mode, respectively. A software-based recovery in triple mode requires 363 clock cycles and occupies 0.612 mm2, representing a 1.3\% area overhead over a non-redundant 12-core {RISC}-V cluster. As a high-performance alternative, a new hardware-based method provides rapid fault recovery in just 24 clock cycles and occupies 0.660 mm2, namely {\textasciitilde}9.4\% area overhead over the baseline non-redundant {RISC}-V cluster. The cluster is also enhanced with split-lock capabilities to enter one of the redundant modes with minimum performance loss, allowing execution of a mission-critical or a performance section, with {\textless}400 clock cycles overhead for entry and exit. The proposed system is the first to integrate these functionalities on an open-source {RISC}-V-based compute device, enabling finely tunable reliability vs. performance trade-offs.},

However, considering actual {RRAM} characteristics, either variability or unexpected permanent failure from the filamentary switching mechanism is observed, degrading recognition performance. This study investigates the impact of fault in a conventional kernel structure, where two adjacent columns in the array represent a single weight, on feature extraction using {MATLAB}. First, the fault types of {HfOx}-based multilevel {RRAM} is categorized. The results reveal that the unidirectional fault of {RRAM} primarily worsens the accuracy of image recognition. This is because the subtraction of negative weights from positive ones is crucial for identifying the edges of images through convolution operations. Therefore, we exploit a kernel structure, in which a single column dedicated to negative weights is located next to a matrix of positive weights. In addition, we reduce the weight precision for negative weights, while quantizing positive weights to higher bits. By mitigating the subtraction errors achieved by the kernel structure with hybrid precision, we improved fault tolerance, minimizing accuracy degradation.},

	abstract = {Hardware faults on the regular 2-D computing array of a typical deep learning accelerator ({DLA}) can lead to dramatic prediction accuracy loss. Prior redundancy design approaches typically have each homogeneous redundant processing element ({PE}) to mitigate faulty {PEs} for a limited region of the 2-D computing array rather than the entire computing array to avoid the excessive hardware overhead. However, they fail to recover the computing array when the number of faulty {PEs} in any region exceeds the number of redundant {PEs} in the same region. The mismatch problem deteriorates when the fault injection rate rises and the faults are unevenly distributed. To address the problem, we propose a hybrid computing architecture ({HyCA}) for faulttolerant {DLAs}. It has a set of dot-production processing units ({DPPUs}) to recompute all the operations that are mapped to the faulty {PEs} despite the faulty {PE} locations. According to our experiments, {HyCA} shows signiﬁcantly higher reliability, scalability, and performance with less chip area penalty when compared to the conventional redundancy approaches. Moreover, by taking advantage of the ﬂexible recomputing, {HyCA} can also be utilized to scan the entire 2-D computing array and detect the faulty {PEs} effectively at runtime.},

Fault injection, however, is not often relevant to emulate real-world software faults since it “blindly” injects large numbers of faults. It remains indeed challenging to inject few but realistic faults that target a particular functionality in a program. In this work, we introduce {iBiR}, a fault injection tool that addresses this challenge by exploring change patterns associated to user-reported faults. To inject realistic faults, we create mutants by re-targeting a bug-report-driven automated program repair system, i.e., reversing its code transformation templates. {iBiR} is further appealing in practice since it requires deep knowledge of neither code nor tests, just of the program’s relevant bug reports. Thus, our approach focuses the fault injection on the feature targeted by the bug report. We assess {iBiR} by considering the Defects4J dataset. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the fault injection performed by traditional mutation testing in terms of semantic similarity with the original bug, when applied at either system or class levels of granularity, and provides better, statistically significant estimations of test effectiveness (fault detection). Additionally, when injecting 100 faults, 
{iBiR} injects faults that couple with the real ones in around 36\% of the cases, while mutation testing achieves less than 4\%.},

	abstract = {Recent research demonstrated the promise of using resistive random access memory ({ReRAM}) as an emerging technology to perform inherently parallel analog domain in-situ matrix-vector multiplication—the intensive and key computation in deep neural networks ({DNNs}). However, hardware failure, such as stuck-at-fault defects, is one of the main concerns that impedes the {ReRAM} devices to be a feasible solution for real implementations. The existing solutions to address this issue usually require an optimization to be conducted for each individual device, which is impractical for mass-produced products (e.g., {IoT} devices). In this paper, we rethink the value of weight pruning in {ReRAM}-based {DNN} design from the perspective of model fault tolerance. And a differential mapping scheme is proposed to improve the fault tolerance under a high stuck-on fault rate. Our method can tolerate almost an order of magnitude higher failure rate than the traditional two-column method in representative {DNN} tasks. More importantly, our method does not require extra hardware cost compared to the traditional two-column mapping scheme. The improvement is universal and does not require the optimization process for each individual device.},

	abstract = {As the dawn of a new age in spaceﬂight approaches, the drive to equip future spacecraft with high-performance computing capabilities is increasing. Many within the industry are looking to leverage solutions enabled by machine learning ({ML}) and artiﬁcial intelligence to enhance mission efﬁciency. Tasks such as image processing and object tracking are desired for long-duration spaceﬂight and extravehicular activities. In order to realize these applications in practice, enhancements to onboard processing are needed. {ML} applications require state-of-the-art processors and hardware accelerators, such as {GPUs}. However, {GPUs} are heavily susceptible to radiation-induced single-event effects ({SEEs}). Additionally, missions require a level of safetycriticality, which is unable to be met by existing commercialoff-the-shelf ({COTS}) {GPUs}. In an effort to create an end-to-end solution, this work aims to bridge {ML}-application development with device-architectural awareness to deliver a fault-aware implementation of the {TensorFlow} framework called Resilient {TensorFlow} ({RTF}). By building customized operations into the {TensorFlow} framework and employing them within the graph of various models, {RTF} demonstrates an ability to mask faults that occur during processing while minimizing overhead. Reducing faults during the processing of deep-learning applications brings the space computing industry closer to realizing onboard highperformance computing.},

We propose to modify rectiﬁed linear unit ({ReLU}), a commonly used activation function in {DNNs}, to tolerate the faults incurred by bit-ﬂip perturbation on weights. Through theoretic analysis of the fault propagation in the layers with {ReLU} activation, we observe that bounding the output of {ReLU} activation can help to tolerate the weight faults. Then, we propose a novel {ReLU} design called boundary-aware {ReLU} ({BReLU}) to improve the reliability of {DNNs}, in which an upper bound of {ReLU} is determined such that the deviation between the boundary and original outputs cannot affect the ﬁnal result. We propose a gradient-ascent-based algorithm to ﬁnd the boundaries for {BReLU} activations of all {DNN} layers. Without retraining the network, our approach is cost effective and practical when deployed in safety-critical artiﬁcial intelligent systems. Detailed experiments and real-life application benchmarking demonstrate that our approach can improve the accuracy of {DNN} {VGG}16 from 16.7\% to 82.6\% on average assuming the practical weight faults, with only 13\% memory and 2.78\% time overhead, respectively.},

The invention discloses a method for constructing an enterprise cloud computing accounting service platform. Collect the internal and external accounting service system data of an enterprise by using an accounting service platform network environment provided by a cloud service provider. Transmit the data to a data processing and storage layer data warehouse for storage after data cleaning, extraction and processing. Then, call the collected data through the data processing and storage layer to analyze the transaction cost-benefit of the enterprise. The intermediate data fault-tolerant model is constructed. After being solved by the ant colony algorithm, the intermediate data generated in the process of cost-benefit analysis and other accounting services are fault-tolerant processed. Finally, the platform accounting service results are output to the interactive interface through the data output display layer. The highest data availability probability of the method proposed in this study is 0. 98, which indicates that the method has high data availability after fault-tolerant processing, and can effectively realize the interaction with users. The experimental analysis shows that the method proposed in this study can effectively analyze the transaction costs and benefits of enterprises. The probability of data availability after fault-tolerant processing is higher, and a load of reading and writing is lower.},

Integrating functionality with different criticality demands has led to the emergence of mixed-criticality systems ({MCS}), which require adaptive fault tolerance to ensure the correctness of critical tasks. In this paper, we propose a hardware-based adaptive redundancy approach for multi-core systems, which aims to enhance the reliability and safety of {MCS}. Our approach involves the reconfiguration of two physical processor cores into a single logical core that executes the same program on demand. The logical core provides adaptive redundancy to detect and mask faults. However, this reconfiguration can potentially result in deadlocks. To address this issue, we identify the scenarios where deadlocks may occur and provide a countermeasure to prevent their emergence. By adopting this runtime adaptive and hardware-based adaptive redundancy method, we can improve the reliability and safety of mixed-criticality systems. At the same time we utilize the processor architecture to abstract the reconfiguration process.},

Additionally, it remains secure against hardware-induced transient fault injection attacks, a classic type of attacks that have been developed on other computing platforms. In this work, we demonstrate that well-trained machine learning models are robust against hardware fault injection attacks when the faults are generated randomly. However, we discover that these models have components, which we refer to as sensitive targets, that are vulnerable to faults. By exploiting this vulnerability, we propose the Lightning attack, which precisely strikes the model’s sensitive targets with hardware-induced transient faults based on the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling ({DVFS}). We design a sensitive targets search algorithm to find the most critical processing units of Deep Neural Network ({DNN}) models determining the inference results, and develop a genetic algorithm to automatically optimize the attack parameters for {DVFS} to induce faults. Experiments on three commodity Nvidia {GPUs} for four widely-used {DNN} models show that the proposed Lightning attack can reduce the inference accuracy by 69.1\% on average for non-targeted attacks, and, more interestingly, achieve a success rate of 67.9\% for targeted attacks.},

Algorithm-based fault tolerance has been proposed as a low-cost mechanism to check online the result of computations against random hardware failures. In this case, the checksum of the actual result is checked against a predicted checksum computed in parallel by a hardware checker. In this work, we target the design of such checkers for convolution engines that are currently the most critical building block in image processing and computer vision applications. The proposed convolution checksum checker, named {ConvGuard}, utilizes a newly introduced invariance condition of convolution to predict implicitly the output checksum using only the pixels at the border of the input image. In this way, {ConvGuard} reduces the power required for accumulating the input pixels without requiring large buffers to hold intermediate checksum results. The design of {ConvGuard} is generic and can be conﬁgured for different output sizes and strides. The experimental results show that {ConvGuard} utilizes only a small percentage of the area/power of an efﬁcient convolution engine while being signiﬁcantly smaller and more power efﬁcient than a state-of-the-art checksum checker for various practical cases.},

In practice, hard-to-model complex environments are unfeasible to be simulated exhaustively within a reasonable time frame. Therefore, some corner-case conditions can be overlooked and design errors might escape to the ﬁnal product. This means that it is imperative for the system to be able to detect and locate bugs to enable self-repair. This is particularly crucial during long-term remote missions in order to apply graceful degradation. This paper proposes a novel online design error localization methodology for microprocessors by immediate analysis of traced and buffered signals upon a failure detection event, using a pre-trained Neural Network ({NN}) and existing processor components, i.e. trace buffers and {AI} accelerators. An in-house Neural Architecture Search ({NAS}) framework is used to train a tailored Multi-Layer Perceptron ({MLP}) {NN} for error localization at the microprocessor module-level resolution. The proposed approach is validated by simulating a {RISC}-V implementation with different workload programs. It is demonstrated to be capable of localizing the microprocessor module of bug origin with 92.81\% accuracy, on average.},

	abstract = {Systolic arrays are a prominent choice for deep neural network ({DNN}) accelerators because they offer parallelism and efficient data reuse. Improving the reliability of {DNN} accelerators is crucial as hardware faults can degrade the accuracy of {DNN} inferencing. Systolic arrays make use of a large number of processing elements ({PEs}) for parallel processing, but when one {PE} is faulty, the error propagates and affects the outcomes of downstream {PEs}. Due to the large number of {PEs}, the cost associated with implementing hardware-based runtime monitoring of every single {PE} is infeasible. We present a solution to optimize the placement of hardware monitors within systolic arrays. We first prove that 2N − 1 monitors are needed to localize a single faulty {PE} and we also derive the monitor placement. We show that a second placement optimization problem, which minimizes the set of candidate faulty {PEs} for a given number of monitors, is {NPhard}. Therefore, we propose a heuristic approach to balance the reliability and hardware resource utilization in {DNN} accelerators when number of monitors is limited. Experimental evaluation shows that to localize a single faulty {PE}, an area overhead of only 0.33\% is incurred for a 256 × 256 systolic array.},

	abstract = {Emerging high-performance computing platforms, with large component counts and lower power margins, are anticipated to be more susceptible to soft errors in both logic circuits and memory subsystems. We present an online algorithm-based fault tolerance ({ABFT}) approach to eﬃciently detect and recover soft errors for general iterative methods. We design a novel checksum-based encoding scheme for matrix-vector multiplication that is resilient to both arithmetic and memory errors. Our design decouples the checksum updating process from the actual computation, and allows adaptive checksum overhead control. Building on this new encoding mechanism, we propose two online {ABFT} designs that can eﬀectively recover from errors when combined with a checkpoint/rollback scheme. These designs are capable of addressing scenarios under diﬀerent error rates. Our {ABFT} approaches apply to a wide range of iterative solvers that primarily rely on matrix-vector multiplication and vector linear operations. We evaluate our designs through comprehensive analytical and empirical analysis. Experimental evaluation on the Stampede supercomputer demonstrates the low performance overheads incurred by our two {ABFT} schemes for preconditioned {CG} (0.4\% and 2.2\%) and preconditioned {BiCGSTAB} (1.0\% and 4.0\%) for the largest {SPD} matrix from {UFL} Sparse Matrix Collection. The evaluation also demonstrates the ﬂexibility and eﬀectiveness of our proposed designs for detecting and recovering various types of soft errors in general iterative methods.},

	abstract = {Typical mobile edge computing infrastructures have to contend with unreliable computing devices at their end-points. The limited resource capacities of mobile edge devices gives rise to frequent contentions, node overloads or failures. This is exacerbated by the strict deadlines of modern applications. To avoid failures, fault-tolerant approaches utilize preemptive migration to transfer active tasks across nodes and prevent nodes running at capacity. However, prior work struggles to dynamically adapt in settings with highly volatile workloads or even accurately detect and diagnose anomalies for optimal remediation. To meet the strict service level objectives of contemporary workloads, there is a need for dynamic fault-tolerant methods that can quickly adapt to changes in edge environments while having parsimonious remediation in the form of preemptive migration to avoid stressing the system network. This work proposes {PreGAN}, featuring a Generative Adversarial Network ({GAN}) based approach to predict contentions, pinpoint specific resource types with high chance of overload, and generate migration decisions to proactively avoid system downtime. {PreGAN} leverages coupled-simulations to train the {GAN} model at run-time and a few-shot fault classifier to update decisions of an underpinning scheduler. We also extend it to {PreGAN}+ that also periodically tunes the decision model using semi-supervised training and a Transformer based neural network for low tuning time, albeit with higher memory overheads. Experiments on a Raspberry-Pi based edge environment demonstrate that both models outperform state-of-the-art baselines in fault detection and diagnosis scores by up to 12.5\% and 31.2\% respectively. This also translates in improvements in Quality of Service against baseline approaches.},

Manufacturing defects and variations lead to hardware faults in the crossbar. Although memristor-based {DNNs} are inherently tolerant to these faults and many faults are benign for a given inferencing application, there is still a non-negligible number of critical faults ({CFs}) in the memristor crossbars that can lead to misclassiﬁcation. It is therefore important to efﬁciently identify these {CFs} so that fault-tolerance solutions can focus on them. In this paper, we present an efﬁcient technique based on machine learning to identify these {CFs}; {CFs} can be identiﬁed with over 98\% accuracy and at a rate that is 20 times faster than a baseline using random fault injection. We next present a fault-tolerance technique that iteratively prunes a {DNN} by targeting weights that are mapped to {CFs} in the memristor crossbars. Our results for the {CIFAR}-10 data set and several benchmark {DNNs} show that the proposed pruning technique eliminates up to 95\% of the {CFs} with less than 1\% {DNN} inferencing accuracy loss. This reduction in the total number of {CFs} leads to a 99\% savings in the hardware redundancy required for fault tolerance.},

Beyond the additional usage afforded by {WL}, row-sparing and focused error correction can extend the lifetime further after wear faults appear.

	abstract = {Quantum computing is poised to solve practically useful problems which are computationally intractable for classical supercomputers. However, the current generation of quantum computers are limited by errors that may only partially be mitigated by developing higher-quality qubits. Quantum error correction ({QEC}) will thus be necessary to ensure fault tolerance. {QEC} protects the logical information by cyclically measuring syndrome information about the errors. An essential part of {QEC} is the decoder, which uses the syndrome to compute the likely effect of the errors on the logical degrees of freedom and provide a tentative correction. The decoder must be accurate, fast enough to keep pace with the {QEC} cycle (e.g., on a microsecond timescale for superconducting qubits) and with hard real-time system integration to support logical operations. As such, real-time decoding is essential to realize fault-tolerant quantum computing and to achieve quantum advantage. In this work, we highlight some of the key challenges facing the implementation of real-time decoders while providing a succinct summary of the progress to-date. Furthermore, we lay out our perspective for the future development and provide a possible roadmap for the field of real-time decoding in the next few years. As the quantum hardware is anticipated to scale up, this perspective article will provide a guidance for researchers, focusing on the most pressing issues in real-time decoding and facilitating the development of solutions across quantum and computer science.},

Moreover, while the resilience of {CNNs} have been extensively investigated to enable their energy-efficient implementations, the analysis of {CapsNets}’ resilience is a largely unexplored area, that can provide a strong foundation to investigate techniques to overcome the {CapsNets}’ complexity challenge. Following the trend of Approximate Computing to enable energyefficient designs, we perform an extensive resilience analysis of the {CapsNets} inference subjected to the approximation errors. Our methodology models the errors arising from the approximate components (like multipliers), and analyze their impact on the classification accuracy of {CapsNets}. This enables the selection of approximate components based on the resilience of each operation of the {CapsNet} inference. We modify the {TensorFlow} framework to simulate the injection of approximation noise (based on the models of the approximate components) at different computational operations of the {CapsNet} inference. Our results show that the {CapsNets} are more resilient to the errors injected in the computations that occur during the dynamic routing (the softmax and the update of the coefficients), rather than other stages like convolutions and activation functions. Our analysis is extremely useful towards designing efficient {CapsNet} hardware accelerators with approximate components. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proof-of-concept for employing approximations on the specialized {CapsNet} hardware.},

	abstract = {Until recently, Approximate Computing ({AxC}) was considered to be a trend topic mainly for resilient applications. Its use aimed at reducing area and power consumption of Integrated Circuits ({ICs}) at the cost of a reduced accuracy. Beside, {AxC}-based fault-tolerance has also emerged recently to save area et power consumption w.r.t. conventional fault-tolerance at the cost of a reduced reliability level. Therefore, approximate fault-tolerance is restricted to non-critical applications. In a previous work, a Quadruple Approximate Modular Redundancy ({QAMR}) scheme, based on using four approximate circuit copies, was proposed. In a single fault scenario, it provides the same reliability level as Triple Modular Redundancy ({TMR}). Moreover, {QAMR} allows reducing area and power consumption costs w.r.t. {TMR} in many cases. In this paper, we study the occurrence of multiple faults, and compare the {QAMR} and {TMR} behaviors. Experimental results highlight the {TMR} overprovision (i.e. it provides more redundancy than necessary) and show how the {QAMR} approach can reduce it. Moreover, a thorough analysis of the results shows that a high tolerance to multiple faults is associated to a large circuit area and to a lower percentage of logic shared among different fan-in cones of the circuit outputs.

Advanced reliability estimations for these {FPGA} platforms are presented, using various modules and prediction methods of {CARE}-{CAD} tool, a powerful software tool for reliability analysis (Mean Time Between Failures Module, Fault Tree Analysis Module, Reliability Block Diagram Module). After various reliability estimations are performed considering every functional block of the {FPGA} platforms, fault tolerance analyses are performed. Fault tolerant techniques, based on hardware redundancy, are suggested for the less reliable blocks of the platforms. New reliability analyses are performed to see if the addition of redundant blocks and components is justified, improving the reliability of the platforms for short and long mission times. Estimating the reliability of various blocks of the {FPGA} platforms help the designer to make the necessary changes, designing more robust products.},

	abstract = {Thanks to {RISC}-V open-source Instruction Set Architecture, researchers and developers can efficiently propose new solutions at a low-cost and low-power consumption. {RISC}-Vbased architectures can, then, be customized to run Machine Learning ({ML}) algorithms efficiently and be inserted on safety and mission-critical domains, where the execution must be reliable. However, a fault in the hardware resources can compromise the system’s ability to operate correctly. Thus, it is necessary to characterize the {ML} applications’ vulnerabilities on {RISCV} processors, as it is not as thoroughly characterized as other accelerators. This work is the first to evaluate the neutroninduced error rate of Convolutional Neural Network ({CNN}) basic operations running on a {RISC}-V processor, {GAP}8. Our results show that executing the algorithm in parallel increases performance, and memory errors are the major contributors to the device error rate. We show that the error rate of the {GAP}8 unprotected memories is one order of magnitude higher than the {CNN} basic operations.},

Therefore, the reliability evaluation of those computational systems is mandatory. The reliability evaluation of {CNNs} is performed by fault injection campaigns at different levels of abstraction, from the application level down to the hardware level. Many works have focused on evaluating the reliability of neural networks in the presence of transient faults. However, the effects of permanent faults have been investigated at the application level, only, e.g., targeting the parameters of the network. This paper intends to propose a framework, resorting to a binary instrumentation tool to perform fault injection campaigns, targeting different components inside the {GPU}, such as the register files and the functional units. This environment allows for the first time assessing the reliability of {CNNs} deployed on a {GPU} considering the presence of permanent faults.},

The execution of reduced precision operations, when acceptable for certain applications, is likely to reduce both the execution time and the power consumption. However, the application's error rate and the device's reliability can also be impacted by these precision changes. In this paper, we study the impact of data and operation precision changes on the reliability of modern architectures. We consider Xilinx Field-Programmable Gate-Arrays ({FPGA}), Intel Xeon Phis, and {NVIDIA} Graphics Processing Units ({GPUs}) executing a set of codes implemented in double, single, and half-precision {IEEE}754-compliant float point data. On {FPGAs}, the reduced area and performance improvements brought by reduced precision operations increase reliability. On Xeon Phis the compiler biases significantly double and single-precision instructions execution. This raises the drawback of increasing single-precision error rates when compared to double-precision operations. {NVIDIA} {GPUs} make use of dedicated mixed-precision cores, which draw nontrivial effects on the device reliability. Generically speaking, on {GPUs} half-precision allows a higher number of executions to be correctly completed before experimenting a failure. Finally, we also evaluate how transient faults impact the output correctness. Our study shows that for most applications faults in a single or half-precision data or operation are more likely to significantly modify the output value than errors in double-precision data.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks ({DNNs}) in safety-critical applications demand high reliability even when running on edge-computing devices. Recent works on System-on-Chip ({SoC}) design with state-of-the-art ({SOTA}) hardware artificial intelligence ({AI}) accelerators and corresponding multi-bit-width ({MBW}) convolutional neural network ({CNN}) generation strategies show that {MBW} {CNNs} can effectively explore the trade-off between network accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, reliability has not been considered in such trade-off analysis, even though highly quantized {CNNs} may elevate the impact of bit flips in the hardware. Also, the reliability of the microcontroller and its interface operating with the {AI} accelerator are not studied. This work evaluates the reliability of {DNN} computation in an {SoC} that includes a processor, {SOTA} {AI} accelerator, and {NN} models highly optimized for computation efficiency using a neural architecture search ({NAS}) method. Focusing on neutron-induced soft error, which is the primary source of bit-flip errors in a terrestrial environment, we perform fault injection and neutron beam experiments. For these experiments, we prototype the {SoC} on a flash-based {FPGA} platform, in which the configuration memory is robust to neutron irradiation. Then, we analyze the experimental data and identify vulnerable components in the system. Furthermore, we evaluate how the {SoC} running different {NAS}-optimized {MBW} {LeNet}5 networks impact the performance, radiation sensitivity, failure rate of {MBW} accelerator, and crash rate of the system on the {FPGAs}. Our results show that instruction and data tightly coupled memory (I/{DTCM}) are the most vulnerable parts and the control status registers ({CSRs}) in our accelerator are the second most vulnerable component. Moreover, {MBW} networks have higher susceptibility to critical errors than single-precision networks, low-precision data are more likely to affect the classification results, and the high bits are more sensitive to faults.},

Results obtained from both radiation experiments and {FI} campaigns reveal that performance and reliability can be improved up to 117× by ofﬂoading the workload of an {APSoC}-based system to its programmable logic core.

	abstract = {To maximize the performance and energy efﬁciency of Spiking Neural Network ({SNN}) processing on resource-constrained embedded systems, specialized hardware accelerators/chips are employed. However, these {SNN} chips may suffer from permanent faults which can affect the functionality of weight memory and neuron behavior, thereby causing potentially signiﬁcant accuracy degradation and system malfunctioning. Such permanent faults may come from manufacturing defects during the fabrication process, and/or from device/transistor damages (e.g., due to wear out) during the run-time operation. However, the impact of permanent faults in {SNN} chips and the respective mitigation techniques have not been thoroughly investigated yet. Toward this, we propose {RescueSNN}, a novel methodology to mitigate permanent faults in the compute engine of {SNN} chips without requiring additional retraining, thereby signiﬁcantly cutting down the design time and retraining costs, while maintaining the throughput and quality. The key ideas of our {RescueSNN} methodology are (1) analyzing the characteristics of {SNN} under permanent faults; (2) leveraging this analysis to improve the {SNN} fault-tolerance through effective fault-aware mapping ({FAM}); and (3) devising lightweight hardware enhancements to support {FAM}. Our {FAM} technique leverages the fault map of {SNN} compute engine for (i) minimizing weight corruption when mapping weight bits on the faulty memory cells, and (ii) selectively employing faulty neurons that do not cause signiﬁcant accuracy degradation to maintain accuracy and throughput, while considering the {SNN} operations and processing dataﬂow. The experimental results show that our {RescueSNN} improves accuracy by up to 80\% while maintaining the throughput reduction below 25\% in high fault rate (e.g., 0.5 of the potential fault locations), as compared to running {SNNs} on the faulty chip without mitigation. In this manner, the embedded systems that employ {RescueSNN}-enhanced chips can efﬁciently ensure reliable executions against permanent faults during their operational lifetime.},

Safety-critical applications have to be resilient with respect to hardware faults and Deep Learning ({DL}) accelerators are subjected to hardware faults that can cause functional failures, potentially leading to catastrophic consequences. Although {DNNs} possess a certain level of intrinsic resilience, it varies depending on the hardware on which they are run. The intent of the paper is to assess the resilience of a systolic-array-based {DNN} accelerator in the presence of hardware faults, in order to identify the architectural parameters that may mainly impact the {DNN} resilience.},

Lossy compression is one of the candidate strategies to address the big data issue. However, little work was done to make it resilient against silent errors, which may happen during the stage of compression or data transferring. In this paper, we propose a resilient error-bounded lossy compressor based on the {SZ} compression framework. Specifically, we design a new independentblock-wise model that decomposes the entire dataset into many independent sub-blocks to compress. Then, we design and implement a series of error detection/correction strategies elaboratively for each stage of {SZ}. Our method is arguably the first algorithmbased fault tolerance ({ABFT}) solution for lossy compression. Our proposed solution incurs negligible execution overhead in the faultfree situation. Upon soft errors happening, it ensures decompressed data strictly bounded within user’s requirement with a very limited degradation of compression ratio and low overhead.},

Various schemes have been proposed to protect embedded systems from the threat of soft errors, but they incur considerable overheads in terms of cost and performance. Selective protection techniques seem promising because they can achieve high levels of protection with low overhead. Though these techniques can be applied to any system, the most vulnerable parts must first be identified. We, therefore, present {CFA}, a comprehensive failure analysis framework that can analyze the vulnerability of microarchitectural components and software instructions through intensive fault injection campaigns. With {CFA}, we also explore the vulnerability of ten benchmarks from the {MiBench} benchmark suite. We found that protecting a part of the system heavily affects the reliability of the other parts. Therefore, all combinations of protection methods must be examined to present the most efficient and effective protection guidelines. Throughout the experiments, we observed that protection methods offered by single-perspective analyses are sub-optimal. On the other hand, {CFA} finds the optimal solution in every case, reducing the {AVF} of a system by up to 82\% with minimal protection.},

Thanks to their low-cost, low-power consumption, and ﬂexibility, ﬁeld-programmable gate arrays ({FPGAs}) are among the promising devices to implement neural networks. Unfortunately, {FPGAs} are also known to be susceptible to radiation-induced errors. In this paper, we evaluate the effects of radiation-induced errors in the output correctness of two neural networks [Iris Flower artiﬁcial neural network ({ANN}) and Modiﬁed National Institute of Standards and Technology ({MNIST}) convolutional neural network ({CNN})] implemented in static random-access memory-based {FPGAs}. In particular, we notice that radiation can induce errors that modify the output of the network with or without affecting the neural network’s functionality. We call the former critical errors and the latter tolerable errors. Through exhaustive fault injection, we identify the portions of Iris Flower {ANN} and {MNIST} {CNN} implementation on {FPGAs} that are more likely, once corrupted, to generate a critical or a tolerable error. Based on this analysis, we propose a selective hardening strategy that triplicates only the most vulnerable layers of the neural network.

	abstract = {In the literature, it is argued that Deep Neural Networks ({DNNs}) possess a certain degree of robustness mainly for two reasons: their distributed and parallel architecture, and their redundancy introduced due to over provisioning. Indeed, they are made, as a matter of fact, of more neurons with respect to the minimal number required to perform the computations. It means that they could withstand errors in a bounded number of neurons and continue to function properly. However, it is also known that different neurons in {DNNs} have divergent fault tolerance capabilities. Neurons that contribute the least to the ﬁnal prediction accuracy are less sensitive to errors. Conversely, the neurons that contribute most are considered critical because errors within them could seriously compromise the correct functionality of the {DNN}. This paper presents a software methodology based on a Triple Modular Redundancy technique, which aims at improving the overall reliability of the {DNN}, by selectively protecting a reduced set of critical neurons. Our ﬁndings indicate that the robustness of the {DNNs} can be enhanced, clearly, at the cost of a larger memory footprint and a small increase in the total execution time. The trade-offs as well as the improvements are discussed in the work by exploiting two {DNN} architectures: {ResNet} and {DenseNet} trained and tested on {CIFAR}-10.},

	abstract = {Artiﬁcial Neural networks ({ANNs}) are widely used to solve classiﬁcation problems for many machine learning applications. When errors occur in the computational units of an {ANN} implementation due to for example radiation effects, the result of an arithmetic operation can be changed, and therefore, the predicted classiﬁcation class may be erroneously affected. This is not acceptable when {ANNs} are used in many safety-critical applications, because the incorrect classiﬁcation may result in a system failure. Existing errortolerant techniques usually rely on physically replicating parts of the {ANN} implementation or incurring in a signiﬁcant computation overhead. Therefore, efﬁcient protection schemes are needed for {ANNs} that are run on a processor and used in resource-limited platforms. A technique referred to as Selective Neuron Re-Computation ({SNRC}), is proposed in this paper. As per the {ANN} structure and algorithmic properties, {SNRC} can identify the cases in which the errors have no impact on the outcome; therefore, errors only need to be handled by re-computation when the classiﬁcation result is detected as unreliable. Compared with existing temporal redundancybased protection schemes, {SNRC} saves more than 60 percent of the re-computation (more than 90 percent in many cases) overhead to achieve complete error protection as assessed over a wide range of datasets. Different activation functions are also evaluated.},

	abstract = {The increasing scale and complexity of today’s highperformance computing ({HPC}) systems demand a renewed focus on enhancing the resilience of long-running scientiﬁc applications in the presence of faults. Many of these applications are iterative in nature as they operate on sparse matrices that concern the simulation of partial differential equations ({PDEs}) which numerically capture the physical properties on discretized spatial domains. While these applications currently beneﬁt from many application-agnostic resilience techniques at the system level, such as checkpointing and replication, there is signiﬁcant overhead in deploying these techniques. In this paper, we seek to develop application-aware resilience techniques that leverage an iterative application’s intrinsic resiliency to faults and selectively protect certain elements, thereby reducing the resilience overhead. Speciﬁcally, we investigate the impact of soft errors on the widely used Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient ({PCG}) method, whose reliability depends heavily on the error propagation through the sparse matrix-vector multiplication ({SpMV}) operation. By characterizing the performance of {PCG} in correlation with a numerical property of the underlying sparse matrix, we propose a selective protection scheme that protects only certain critical elements of the operation based on an analytical model. An experimental evaluation using 20 sparse matrices from the {SuiteSparse} Matrix Collection shows that our proposed scheme is able to reduce the resilience overhead by as much as 70.2\% and an average of 32.6\% compared to the baseline techniques with full-protection or zero-protection.},

This paper proposes a fault-tolerant, scalable, multiprocessor system architecture that adopts a pipeline scheme. To verify the performance of the proposed system, the {SimEvent}/Stateflow tool of the {MATLAB} program was used to simulate the system. The proposed system uses twelve processors (P), connected in a linear array, to build a ten-stage system with two backup processors ({BP}). However, the system can be expanded by adding more processors to increase pipeline stages and performance, and more backup processors to increase system reliability. The system can automatically reorganize itself in the event of a failure of one or two processors and execution continues without interruption. Each processor communicates with its neighboring processors through input/output (I/O) ports which are used as bypass links between the processors. In the event of a processor failure, the function of the faulty processor is assigned to the next processor that is free from faults. The fast Fourier transform ({FFT}) algorithm is implemented on the simulated circuit to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The results showed that the system can continue to execute even if one or two processors fail without a noticeable decrease in performance.},

Examples of these systems are advanced driver assistance systems ({ADAS}). Failures in these systems could have severe consequences. Therefore, these systems should be thoroughly evaluated during different stages of product development. An effective way of evaluating these systems is through the injection of faults and monitoring their impacts on these systems. Fault injection can be conducted either through the field tests or simulation-based tests. While conducting field tests could be costly and sometimes lifethreatening [1], [2], simulation-based tests provide a wide range of advantages, such as adaptation of tests to a variety of traffic scenarios and avoiding the life-threatening situations. In this paper, we present {SUFI}, a simulation-based fault injector that is capable of injecting faults into {ADAS} features (e.g., car-following and lane-changing) modelled in {SUMO} (simulation of urban mobility). Using {SUFI}, we model different faults and measure their impacts on the target system. The results of the fault injection experiments show the effectiveness of {SUFI} in revealing weaknesses of {ADAS} features modelled in {SUMO} when targeted by faults and attacks.},

If the value is zero, then the corresponding multiply-accumulate operation is bypassed. We subjected the implementation of our optimization technique to radiation test campaigns using ∼14 {MeV} neutrons, and found the proposed optimization technique to improve the fault tolerance of the tested neural network by a factor of 1.78 times.},

In this work, faulttolerant digital Finite Impulse Response ({FIR}) and Infinite Impulse Response ({IIR}) filters, which have the same impulse response that process different signal inputs and different responses that process the same signal inputs are designed using Hamming code to detect and correct singlebit soft errors.

In this work, we propose machine learning ({ML})-based prediction frameworks for the soft error vulnerability evaluation of {GPGPU} programs. We consider program characteristics, hardware usage and performance metrics collected from the simulation and the profiling tools. While we utilize regression models to predict the masked fault rates, we build classification models to specify the vulnerability level of the {GPGPU} programs based on their silent data corruption ({SDC}) and crash rates. Our prediction models achieve maximum prediction accuracy rates of 95.9, 88.46, and 85.7\% for masked fault rates, {SDCs}, and crashes, respectively.},

Thus, Deep Neural Network ({DNN}) algorithms are implemented on different systems, from small embedded devices to data centers. {DNN} accelerators have proven to be a key to efficiency, as they are even more efficient than {CPUs}. Therefore, they have become the major executing hardware for {DNN} algorithms. However, these accelerators are susceptible to several types of faults. Soft errors pose a particular threat because the high-level parallelism in these accelerators can propagate a single failure to mul­ tiple errors in the next levels until the model predictions’ output is affected. This article presents a compre­ hensive review of the reliability of the {DNN} accelerators. The study begins by reviewing the widely assumed claim that {DNNs} are inherently tolerant to faults. Then, the available {DNN} accelerators are systematically classified into several categories. Each is individually analyzed; and the commonly used accelerators are compared in an attempt to answer the question, which accelerator is more reliable against transient faults? The concluding part of this review highlights the gray areas of the {DNNs} and predicts future research directions that will enhance its applicability.

However, modern {GPUs} are prone to radiation-induced soft errors, which is a serious issue in safety-compliant systems.

We perform an indepth analysis of the model from the perspective of layer and kernel vulnerability. Then, we experimentally show the vulnerability of {ResNet} models and identify the most vulnerable portions. Finally, we validate our solution, which is a selective-hardening technique, through hardening the worth-hardening kernels to avoid unnecessary overheads. Our strategy is demonstrated to mask up to 93.38\% of the injected errors with performance overhead less than 5.35\%. Furthermore, the percentage of the errors causing misclassiﬁcations can be reduced from 4.2\% to 0.104\%, thereby signiﬁcantly improving the model’s reliability.},

	abstract = {Specialized hardware accelerators have been designed and employed to maximize the performance efficiency of Spiking Neural Networks ({SNNs}). However, such accelerators are vulnerable to transient faults (i.e., soft errors), which occur due to high-energy particle strikes, and manifest as bit flips at the hardware layer. These errors can change the weight values and neuron operations in the compute engine of {SNN} accelerators, thereby leading to incorrect outputs and accuracy degradation. However, the impact of soft errors in the compute engine and the respective mitigation techniques have not been thoroughly studied yet for {SNNs}. A potential solution is employing redundant executions (re-execution) for ensuring correct outputs, but it leads to huge latency and energy overheads. Toward this, we propose {SoftSNN}, a novel methodology to mitigate soft errors in the weight registers (synapses) and neurons of {SNN} accelerators without re-execution, thereby maintaining the accuracy with low latency and energy overheads. Our {SoftSNN} methodology employs the following key steps: (1) analyzing the {SNN} characteristics under soft errors to identify faulty weights and neuron operations, which are required for recognizing faulty {SNN} behavior; (2) a Bound-and-Protect technique that leverages this analysis to improve the {SNN} fault tolerance by bounding the weight values and protecting the neurons from faulty operations; and (3) devising lightweight hardware enhancements for the neural hardware accelerator to efficiently support the proposed technique. The experimental results show that, for a 900-neuron network with even a high fault rate, our {SoftSNN} maintains the accuracy degradation below 3\%, while reducing latency and energy by up to 3x and 2.3x respectively, as compared to the re-execution technique.},

This article surveys the current state-of-the-art of fault tolerance approaches when used in the context of real-time systems, identifying the main challenges and the cross-links between these two topics. We propose a joint scheduling-failure analysis model that highlights the formal interactions among software fault tolerance mechanisms and timing properties. This model allows us to present and discuss many open research questions with the final aim to spur future research activities.},

Existing techniques for protecting {CNNs} from {DRAM} errors are either expensive or fail to protect from largegranularity, multi-bit errors, which occur commonly in {DRAMs}. We propose a software-implemented coding scheme, Structural Coding ({SC}) for protecting {CNNs} from large-granularity memory errors. {SC} achieves three orders of magnitude reduction in Silent Data Corruption ({SDC}) rates of {CNNs} compared to no protection. Its average error correction coverage is also significantly higher than other software techniques to protect {CNNs} from faults in the memory. Further, its average performance, memory, and energy overheads are respectively 3\%, 15.71\%, and 4.38\%. These overheads are much lower than other software protection techniques.},

In this paper we present a statistical simulation approach for fault-tolerance analysis of satellite On-Board Computers ({OBCs}) that are based on Commercial Off-The-Shelf ({COTS}) components. Since the logic level of {COTS} electronics is unknown to satellite designers, a new higher-level fault-tolerance analysis is required. We propose such technique that relies on {OBC} modeling and fault modeling, based on the modeling principle of Single-Event Upsets ({SEUs}). For the ﬁrst time we can compare the efﬁciency of fault-tolerance techniques implemented in software and Field-Programmable Gate Array ({FPGA}). In addition, our approach enables to analyze system fault-tolerance at early development stages. In a case study the approach is applied to an {OBC} with a Microsemi {SmartFusion} {SoC}, that executes a satellite attitude control algorithm. The gained statistical simulation results enabled 50\% reduction in the hardware overhead of the implemented memory scrubbing technique without loss in fault-tolerance. Our method revealed critical fault-tolerance drawbacks of the initial system design that could have lead to satellite mission failure.},

	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks ({CNN}) have become essential for many scientiﬁc and industrial applications, such as image classiﬁcation and pattern detection. Among the devices that can implement neural networks, {SRAM} based {FPGAs} are a popular option due to their excellent parallel computing capability and good ﬂexibility. However, {SRAM}-{FPGAs} are susceptible to radiation effects, which limits its application on safety critical applications. In this paper, the reliability of an accelerator based on the advanced Instruction-Set Architecture is evaluated based on hardware fault injection experiments. Each main module of the accelerator is evaluated separately, and the impact of parallelism and model features on the accelerator reliability is also examined. The experimental results reveal some important conclusions in terms of general hardware reliability and also of the particular model reliability. First, over 99\% of {SEUs} on the computation modules will cause accuracy loss, and the reliability improves for higher parallelism. Second, a large portion of {SEUs} on the data mover and the instruction scheduler will cause system corruptions due to abnormal interactions with the {ARM} or other modules. Third, nonlinear activation and pooling layers are effective in reducing the effect of {SEUs} on computation modules, so models that use these layers tend to be more robust. The results provide a deep understanding of the impact of errors on {CNNs} implemented on {ISA} based {FPGA} accelerators (e.g., the Xilinx {DPU}).},

However, the highly integrated Tensor Cores are vulnerable to transient faults (i.e., soft errors), causing catastrophic consequences in safety-critical applications like automatic driving. Thus, it is imperative to estimate the reliability of {CNNs} on Tensor Cores. However, obtaining a statistically significant resilience profile of {CNNs} on Tensor Cores with the existing fault injection ({FI})-based reliability estimation methods is expensive. To this end, we build {TC}-{SEPM} to predict the error resilience of {CNNs} on Tensor Cores instead of {FI} methods. To ensure the accuracy of {TC}-{SEPM}, we first investigate resilience-related features from program and microarchitecture perspectives. Then, leveraging these heuristic features, we train machine learning models to learn the hidden relationship between error resilience and the investigated features, enabling us to predict the impact of soft errors in Tensor Cores on {CNN} output. Experimental results show that {TC}-{SEPM} achieves high accuracy for individual soft error resiliency prediction and overall program resilience estimation while its overhead is only 1/27 of {FI} methods. Additionally, {TCSEPM} can provide valuable insights for programmers or architects to design more robust {CNN} models on Tensor Cores.},

However, {FPGAs} that can be used to accelerate various computations are prone to configuration memory faults that determine their function. Repairing these faults is essential to increase system resilience. For this purpose, the partial dynamic reconfiguration controller is necessary. We force the controller to be on the same {FPGA} with a payload circuit to design a comprehensive system inside one {FPGA}. We create and thoroughly test a new reconfiguration controller to increase the system’s resiliency with the ability to repair itself during its own operation. For this purpose, the {FPGA} controller is in coarse-grained triple modular redundancy to be able to recover despite the failure of any of its modules. The proposed controller has been tested to increase the resilience of circuits from a set of benchmark circuits. The entire system with the controller was evaluated on an actual {FPGA}, where faults were injected directly into the configuration memory of this {FPGA}. Reliability parameters are measured by a platform designed for this purpose, partly directly on the tested {FPGA}. As we can see from the results, the mean time to failure has been increased by up to 69\% compared to a system equipped with only triple modular redundancy with a reasonable amount of hardware resources. The competitive solution brings only a 42\% improvement in resilience with similar parameters.},

We further explore novel, non-uniform range restriction methods that effectively suppress the probability of silent data corruptions and uncorrectable errors. As a safety-relevant end-to-end use case, we showcase the beneﬁt of our approach in a vehicle classiﬁcation scenario, using {ResNet}50 and the trafﬁc camera data set {MIOVision}.

	abstract = {Nanometer circuits are becoming increasingly susceptible to soft errors. Selective hardening is a less expensive technique to improve the reliability of circuits because it hardens the critical components instead of hardening an entire circuit. One challenge of selective hardening is efficiently and effectively identifying the critical parts in circuits. Simulationbased fault injection is commonly used but extremely timeconsuming, especially for complex circuits. This paper proposes an approach based on Graph Neural Networks ({GNNs}) to identify critical flip-flops in circuits. {GNNs} can take advantage of the circuit’s structural features and the features of individual flipflops. To convert the features into abstract data that can be fed into {GNNs}, we provide a feature extraction method that uses a graph model to represent the relevant features of the circuit. The method converts the target circuit into a graph representing its architecture. The graph also contains features of individual flip-flops extracted from the circuit’s netlist and the Value Change Dump ({VCD}) waveforms of the test used for fault simulation. Additionally, we extract edge features in the graph to utilize the information on combinational gates on the path between flip-flops. Datasets generated based on two opensource {RISC}-V cores are used to validate the proposed approach. We compare the performance of different {GNNs} on them and discuss the contribution of edge features to their performance. Our experiments show that the prediction accuracy increases significantly with edge features. {GraphSAGE} and {SAGE}-{GCN} with edge features perform best among the selected {GNNs}. The highest accuracy we achieved on Ibex and {RI}5CY is 97.75\% and 98.67\%, respectively. We also provide a method to accelerate the process of critical flip-flop identification.},

	abstract = {Deep learning neural networks ({DNNs}) have been successful in solving a wide range of machine learning problems. Specialized hardware accelerators have been proposed to accelerate the execution of {DNN} algorithms for high-performance and energy efficiency. Recently, they have been deployed in datacenters (potentially for business-critical or industrial applications) and safety-critical systems such as self-driving cars. Soft errors caused by high-energy particles have been increasing in hardware systems, and these can lead to catastrophic failures in {DNN} systems. Traditional methods for building resilient systems, e.g., Triple Modular Redundancy ({TMR}), are agnostic of the {DNN} algorithm and the {DNN} accelerator’s architecture. Hence, these traditional resilience approaches incur high overheads, which makes them challenging to deploy. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the resilience characteristics of {DNN} systems (i.e., {DNN} software running on specialized accelerators). We find that the error resilience of a {DNN} system depends on the data types, values, data reuses, and types of layers in the design. Based on our observations, we propose two efficient protection techniques for {DNN} systems.},

	abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}) have been used in resource-constrained edge devices, including safetycritical applications. However, recent studies demonstrate that soft errors may result in {CNN} prediction failures. Many approaches are proposed at the end of layers to detect computation errors. Still, these approaches incur severe overheads or cannot detect errors in memory, e.g., traditional Double Modular Redundancy ({DMR}) can protect data integrity in memory, but it incurs significant overheads on time and memory. Some existing {DNNspecific} approaches are lightweight to protect {DNNs} from transient faults but cannot provide high fault coverage to detect permanent faults in memory. Thus, we propose two low-cost software approaches, channel-based weight checksum and layer-based output checksum, which protect the integrity of weights and layer outputs in memory. We perform a large number of fault injections to evaluate the performance of the proposed ap­ proaches and compare them with other approaches. The results show that combining the proposed approaches can provide approximately 100 \% fault coverage for weights and layer outputs in memory. The combination increases total time and memory overheads by 4 \% and 17 \%, respectively, for {DNNs} that run sequentially. In addition, we observe that the layer-based output checksum can improve the error resilience of register files because most {SDCs} caused by register file errors are induced by the control flow error and the pointer error. Finally, we present a case study on {MobileNet} to show that our approaches can be generalized to other {DNN} libraries that run parallel by dividing the single-layer execution into N parts. When N is 2, our approaches in­ crease total time and memory overheads by 7.4 \% and 31 \%, respectively.},

	abstract = {Triple modular redundancy ({TMR}) is one of the most common techniques in fault-tolerant systems, in which the output is determined by a majority voter. However, the design diversity of replicated modules and/or soft errors that are more likely to happen in the nanoscale era may affect the majority voting scheme. Besides, the significant overheads of the {TMR} scheme may limit its usage in energy consumption and area-constrained critical systems. However, for most inherently error-resilient applications such as image processing and vision deployed in critical systems (such as autonomous vehicles and robotics), achieving a given level of reliability has more priority than precise results. Therefore, these applications can benefit from the approximate computing paradigm to achieve higher energy efficiency and a lower area. This article proposes an energy-efficient approximate reliability (X-Rel) framework to overcome the aforementioned challenges of the {TMR} systems and get the full potential of approximate computing without sacrificing the desired reliability constraint and output quality. The X-Rel framework relies on relaxing the precision of the voter based on a systematical error bounding method that leverages user-defined quality and reliability constraints. Afterward, the size of the achieved voter is used to approximate the {TMR} modules such that the overall area and energy consumption are minimized. The effectiveness of employing the proposed X-Rel technique in a {TMR} structure, for different quality constraints as well as with various reliability bounds, is evaluated in a 15-nm {FinFET} technology. The results of the X-Rel voter show delay, area, and energy consumption reductions of up to 86\%, 87\%, and 98\%, respectively, when compared to those of the state-of-the-art approximate {TMR} voters. Also, the effectiveness of the proposed X-Rel-based {TMR} structure is assessed in four benchmark applications from different domains. For these benchmarks, the results show 1.59×, 2.35×, and 3.39× energydelay-area-product ({EDAP}) reduction for less than 1\%, 5\%, and 10\% output quality degradations, respectively. Finally, an image processing application is benchmarked to evaluate the X-Rel framework efficacy in the presence of errors, where the results show up to a 4.78× higher output image quality in comparison with the typical {TMR} voters.},

	abstract = {Analog computing has reemerged as a promising avenue for accelerating deep neural networks ({DNNs}) due to its potential to overcome the energy efficiency and scalability challenges posed by traditional digital architectures. However, achieving high precision and {DNN} accuracy using such technologies is challenging, as highprecision data converters are costly and impractical. In this paper, we address this challenge by using the residue number system ({RNS}). {RNS} allows composing highprecision operations from multiple low-precision operations, thereby eliminating the information loss caused by the limited precision of the data converters. Our study demonstrates that analog accelerators utilizing the {RNS}-based approach can achieve ≥99\% of {FP}32 accuracy for state-of-the-art {DNN} inference using data converters with only 6-bit precision whereas a conventional analog core requires more than 8-bit precision to achieve the same accuracy in the same {DNNs}. The reduced precision requirements imply that using {RNS} can reduce the energy consumption of analog accelerators by several orders of magnitude while maintaining the same throughput and precision. Our study extends this approach to {DNN} training, where we can efficiently train {DNNs} using 7-bit integer arithmetic while achieving accuracy comparable to {FP}32 precision. Lastly, we present a faulttolerant dataflow using redundant {RNS} error-correcting codes to protect the computation against noise and errors inherent within an analog accelerator.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the first fault-tolerant resource locking protocol for multiprocessor real-time systems. Resource locking protocols control access to shared resources in real-time systems. Most of the previous studies in resource locking protocols have focused on decreasing blocking time and resource conflicts. The use of such protocols in multiprocessor safety-critical real-time systems necessitates fault tolerance in the design of these systems. However, in research focused on multiprocessor real-time systems, fault tolerance has received low attention in resource allocation studies. In addition, many solutions proposed to improve the reliability in realtime scheduling ignored resource models in their task model. This paper proposes a novel fault-tolerant resource locking protocol, called {FTPIA}-{NPCS}, which considers transient faults in shared resources. {FTPIA}-{NPCS} proposes a checkpointing-based fault-tolerant mechanism to recover from errors caused by transient faults. In this mechanism, a checkpoint is taken from the tasks, before each resource allocation. In addition to providing fault tolerance, {FTPIA}-{NPCS} solves the problem of priority inversion in {NPCS} protocol for periodic tasks with hard deadlines. The simulation results demonstrate that {FTPIA}-{NPCS} tolerates at least one transient fault in resources for each execution of the periodic tasks with 15\% blocking time overhead in comparison to its non-fault-tolerant configuration, called {PIA}-{NPCS}. Furthermore, the blocking time of higher-priority tasks is minimized in com­ parison to {PIA}-{NPCS}. An analytical evaluation of the protocol supports the simulation results.},

	abstract = {Approximate Computing Techniques ({ACTs}) take advantage of resilience computing applications to trade off among output precision, area, power, and performance. {ACTs} can lead to significant gains at affordable costs when efficiently implemented on Field Programmable Gate Array– ({FPGA}) based accelerators. Although several novel {ACTs} works have been proposed for {FPGA} accelerators, their applicability to high-assurance systems has not been explored as much. {ACTs} are becoming necessary in many critical Edge computing systems, such as self-driving cars and Earth observation satellites, to increase computational efficiency. However, an important question comes to mind when targeting critical systems: Does {ACT} optimization negatively affect the reliability of the system and how can one find optimal design architectures that blend classic mitigation techniques like Triple Modular Redundancy with approximation- and precise-based arithmetic hardware units to achieve the best possible computational efficiency without compromising dependability? This work aims to solve this research problem by introducing a Design Space Exploration ({DSE}) methodology that employs {ACTs} in arithmetic units of the design and identifies Pareto-optimal microarchitectures that balance all relevant gains of {ACTs}, such as area, speed, power, failure rate, and precision, by inserting the correct amount of approximation in the design. In a nutshell, our {DSE} methodology has formulated the {DSE} with a Multi-Objective Optimization Problem ({MOP}). Each Pareto-optimal solution of our tool finds which arithmetic units of the design to implement with precise and approximate circuits and which units to selectively triplicate to remove single points of failure that compromise system reliability below acceptable thresholds. We also suggest another formulation of the {DSE} into a Single-Objective constraint Optimization Problem ({ScOP}) producing a single optimal point, and that the user may demand, as a less time-consuming alternative to the {MOP} if a complete Pareto-front is not needed. Our methodology generates fault-tolerant versions of the Pareto-optimal approximate designs (or simple optimized approximate designs if the {ScOP} choice is picked) by selectively applying mitigation techniques in a way that the overheads of redundant resources for fault-tolerance do not negate the gains of approximation in comparison to the fault-tolerant versions of the precise design. We evaluate our method on two {FPGA}-based accelerators: a {JPEG} encoder and an H.264/Advanced Video Coding decoder. Our experimental results show significant gains in area, frequency, and power consumption without compromising output quality and system reliability compared to classic solutions that replicate all or a part of the resources of the precise design to increase dependability metrics.},

Designing a reliable {NoC} against failures that can prevent failure using some measures or preventing error or system failure while failure happens and proper performance became a significant concern. For a reliable design against failures, first, the system should be analysed to discover the critical points. Hence, in this research, it is tried first to investigate the scale of fault tolerance effect on the mechanism in the router on the network by injecting simulated errors, and then these errors are prevented. As the major novelty, the authors implemented a router on a synchronised network and calculated the network buffering fault tolerance by injecting error in the buffer. Specifically, a new method for improving fault tolerance is proposed, which uses the existing resources efficiently. So, it does not impose any overhead on hardware and improves the error tolerance scale. The authors also evaluate it from different perspectives to show its superior performance.},

The error characteristic analysis is used to compare the outputs of the approximate circuit with those of its precise counterpart, which can help to find the most appropriate approximate design for a specific application in the large design space. With the approximate design getting close to physical realization, manufacturing defects and operational faults are inevitable; therefore, the reliability prediction and vulnerability test become increasingly important. However, the research on approximate circuit reliability and test is insufficient and needs more attention. Furtherly, although there is some existing work combining the approximate design with fault tolerant techniques, the reliability-enhancement approaches for approximate circuits are lacking.},

	abstract = {This report examines the state of the field of software fault tolerance. Terminology, techniques for building reliable systems, and fault tolerance are discussed. While a scientific consensus on the measurement of software reliability has not been reached, software systems are sufficiently pervasive that ‘‘software components’’ of larger systems must be reliable, since dependence is placed on them. Fault tolerant systems utilize redundant components to mitigate the effects of component failures, and thus create a system which is more reliable than a single component. This idea can be applied to software systems as well. Several techniques for designing fault tolerant software systems are discussed and assessed qualitatively, where ‘‘software fault’’ refers to what is more commonly known as a bug. The assumptions, relative merits, available experimental results, and implementation experience are discussed for each technique. This leads us to some conclusions about the state of the field.},

Safety-critical applications have strict reliability requirements; therefore, it is essential that {AI} models running on the edge (i.e., hardware) must fulfill the required safety standards. In the vast field of {AI}, Deep Neural Networks ({DNNs}) are the focal point of this survey as it has continued to produce extraordinary outcomes in various applications .i.e medical, automotive, aerospace, defense, etc. Traditional reliability techniques for {DNNs} implementation are not always practical, as they fail to exploit the unique characteristics of the {DNNs}. Furthermore, it is also essential to understand the targeted edge hardware because the impact of the faults can be different in {ASICs} and {FPGAs}. Therefore, in this survey, first, we have examined the impact of the fault in {ASICs} and {FPGAs}, and then we seek to provide a glimpse of the recent progress made towards the fault-tolerant {DNNs}. We have discussed several factors that can impact the reliability of the {DNNs}. Further, we have extended this discussion to shed light on many state-of-the-art fault mitigation techniques for {DNNs}.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) and, in particular, Machine Learning ({ML}) have emerged to be utilized in various applications due to their capability to learn how to solve complex problems. Over the last decade, rapid advances in {ML} have presented Deep Neural Networks ({DNNs}) consisting of a large number of neurons and layers. {DNN} Hardware Accelerators ({DHAs}) are leveraged to deploy {DNNs} in the target applications. Safety-critical applications, where hardware faults/errors would result in catastrophic consequences, also benefit from {DHAs}. Therefore, the reliability of {DNNs} is an essential subject of research. In recent years, several studies have been published accordingly to assess the reliability of {DNNs}. In this regard, various reliability assessment methods have been proposed on a variety of platforms and applications. Hence, there is a need to summarize the state of the art to identify the gaps in the study of the reliability of {DNNs}. In this work, we conduct a Systematic Literature Review ({SLR}) on the reliability assessment methods of {DNNs} to collect relevant research works as much as possible, present a categorization of them, and address the open challenges. Through this {SLR}, three kinds of methods for reliability assessment of {DNNs} are identified including Fault Injection ({FI}), Analytical, and Hybrid methods. Since the majority of works assess the {DNN} reliability by {FI}, we characterize different approaches and platforms of the {FI} method comprehensively. Moreover, Analytical and Hybrid methods are propounded. Thus, different reliability assessment methods for {DNNs} have been elaborated on their conducted {DNN} platforms and reliability evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the identified methods and address the open challenges in the research area.},

	abstract = {We present a co-design approach to establish redundancy schemes such as Dual Modular Redundancy ({DMR}) and Triple Modular Redundancy ({TMR}) to a whole region of a processor array for a class of Coarse-Grained Reconﬁgurable Arrays ({CGRAs}). The approach is applied to applications with mixed-criticality properties and experiencing varying Soft Error Rates ({SERs}) due to environmental reasons, e. g., changing altitude. The core idea is to adapt the degree of fault protection for loop programs executing in parallel on a {CGRA} to the level of reliability required as well as {SER} proﬁles. This is realized through claiming neighbor regions of processing elements for the execution of replicated loop nests. First, at the source code level, a compiler transformation is proposed that realizes these replication schemes in two steps: (1) replicate given parallel loop program two or three times for {DMR} or {TMR}, respectively, and (2) add appropriate error handling functions (voting or comparison) in order to detect respectively correct any single errors. Then, using the opportunities of hardware/software co-design, we propose optimized implementations of the error handling functions in software as well as in hardware. Finally, experimental results are given for the analysis of reliability gains for each proposed scheme of array replication in dependence of different {SERs}.},

A famous {ABFT} technique is to insert checksums into a parallel matrix multiplication, including {LUdecomposition}. It can correct a single incorrect element caused by a bit ﬂip in computation and communication. To correct two incorrect elements, we extend the above {ABFT}, named diagonal checksum, to a parallel matrix multiplier in this study. Simulation results show that the diagonal checksum {ABFT} method has a similar latency overhead to the famous {ABFT} on a parallel computer using an unreliable interconnection network. They also show that the diagonal checksum {ABFT} method works well even when an interconnection network has 10−7 of bit error rate.},

	abstract = {Multiprocessor interconnection networks are mainly required to link a significant number of stable processor memory sets, every one of which is known as a processing vertex. Due to the cost-effectiveness, the design and utilization of multiprocessor interconnection networks have drawn attention lately. An interconnection network is extensively used in a parallel multiprocessor system to connect the processors and memory modules. In multiprocessor networks, vertices represent processors, and each processor of which is subject to complete failure. Fault tolerance is a process that ensures the working of a system to its total capacity, even if one or more of its components fail. In fault-tolerant design, backup components are used in interconnection networks to automatically take the place of the failed component, guaranteeing that the system’s working continues. This paper proposed the fault-tolerant design in the form of Pk j and Ck j graphs, where n processing components are linked, and i of these n components creating a chain of maximum size, are used to perform the task, they can tolerate the failure of components, maintaining steady operation. In particular, we present the fault-tolerant designs of pyramid, {OTIS}, biswapped, and mesh-derived networks.},
