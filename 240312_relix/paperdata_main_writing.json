It covers novel architectures, redundancy schemes, and error-resiliency mechanisms that aim to mitigate the impact of hardware faults on deep learning computations. The discussion is structured around several key themes, including lightweight error-resiliency mechanisms, novel fault-tolerant architectures, selective mitigation techniques, and innovative coding strategies.\n\n\\subsection{Lightweight Error-Resiliency Mechanisms}\n\nA primary concern in designing fault-tolerant hardware for deep learning is the balance between reliability and resource overhead. \\cite{goldstein_lightweight_2021} introduces a low-cost error-resiliency scheme targeting Multiply-and-Accumulate (MAC) units in DNN accelerators. This approach achieves significant fault coverage with minimal area and power overhead, demonstrating the feasibility of enhancing reliability in power-constrained environments.

This approach allows for concurrent error detection at the tile level without impacting performance, showcasing a direct application to deep learning computations. In a similar vein, \\cite{barbirotta_fault-tolerant_2023} explores the integration of redundant vector co-processors in a RISC-V architecture, enhancing the fault tolerance of high-performance edge-computing nodes for deep learning applications.\n\n\\subsection{Selective Mitigation and Advanced Coding Strategies}\n\nSelective mitigation techniques and advanced coding strategies offer targeted solutions to enhance fault tolerance. \\cite{adam_selective_2021} demonstrates a selective mitigation technique for soft errors in DNN models used in healthcare applications, significantly reducing error-induced malfunctions with minimal performance overhead. This approach underscores the importance of fault tolerance in safety-critical systems. Furthermore, \\cite{yu_cola_nodate} explores error coding and learning strategies to improve neural network inference robustness against hardware defects, introducing a comprehensive error decorrelation framework that enhances both clean and robust accuracy.\n\n\\cite{nguyen_craft_2023} proposes CRAFT, a criticality-aware fault-tolerance enhancement technique for emerging memories-based DNNs, addressing stuck-at faults to enhance reliability with minimal storage overhead.

Additionally, \\cite{fuengfusin_efficient_2023} introduces an efficient repetition coding method for protecting DNNs from write-errors in non-volatile memory devices, showcasing an innovative approach to fault tolerance in emerging memory technologies.\n\n\\subsection{Discussion and Future Directions}\n\nThe literature reviewed in this section highlights significant advancements in designing fault-tolerant hardware for deep learning. While these studies demonstrate the feasibility of various strategies\u2014from lightweight error-resiliency mechanisms to novel fault-tolerant architectures and selective mitigation techniques\u2014the challenge remains in balancing reliability, performance, and resource overhead. Future research should focus on developing more adaptive and scalable fault-tolerance solutions that can be easily integrated into existing and emerging deep learning hardware platforms.

The exploration of these technologies and paradigms reveals a landscape rich with opportunities for innovation in the realm of hardware fault tolerance, crucial for the next generation of deep learning applications.\n\n\\subsection{Neuromorphic Computing and Memristors}\n\nNeuromorphic computing, inspired by the neural structures of the human brain, presents a promising avenue for fault-tolerant deep learning hardware. The work by Yerima et al. on a fault-tolerant spiking neural network mapping algorithm and architecture for neuromorphic systems highlights the potential of neuromorphic computing in addressing noise and external interference, which are common issues in deep learning hardware \\cite{yerima_fault-tolerant_2023}. Similarly, Jeon et al.'s investigation into hybrid precision in resistive memory-based convolutional kernels for neuromorphic systems underscores the role of novel memory technologies, like memristors, in enhancing fault resilience \\cite{jeon_hybrid_2023}. These studies suggest that leveraging the inherent fault tolerance of neuromorphic computing and the unique properties of memristors could lead to more robust deep learning systems.\n\n\\subsection{Hybrid and Specialized Architectures}\n\nThe exploration of hybrid and specialized computing architectures offers another path toward fault-tolerant deep learning. The CHREC Space Processor (CSP) project, which combines commercial-off-the-shelf devices with radiation-hardened processors and fault-tolerant computing techniques, exemplifies the potential of hybrid architectures in specialized environments such as space computing \\cite{rudolph_csp_nodate}. This approach could inspire similar strategies in deep learning hardware, where a mix of cutting-edge and robust technologies ensures both performance and reliability. Furthermore, the development of the Hybrid Computing Architecture (HyCA) for fault-tolerant deep learning accelerators, as proposed by Liu et al., demonstrates the effectiveness of innovative architecture designs in overcoming the limitations of conventional redundancy approaches \\cite{liu_hyca_2021}.\n\n\\subsection{Fault Tolerance Techniques and Strategies}\n\nAdvancements in fault tolerance techniques and strategies specifically tailored for deep learning hardware are critical for mitigating the impact of hardware errors. The work by Yuan et al. on improving DNN fault tolerance using weight pruning and differential crossbar mapping for ReRAM-based edge AI showcases a specific approach to enhancing hardware fault tolerance \\cite{yuan_improving_2021}. Similarly, Chen et al.'s pruning technique for fault-tolerant memristor-based accelerators offers insights into efficiently identifying and mitigating critical faults in hardware \\cite{chen_pruning_2021}. These techniques, along with the novel methodologies proposed by Putra et al. in RescueSNN for mitigating permanent faults in SNN accelerators, underscore the importance of developing targeted strategies for enhancing the reliability of deep learning hardware \\cite{putra_rescuesnn_2023}.\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Layer and System-Wide Approaches}\n\nA comprehensive understanding of fault propagation and the development of system-wide fault tolerance approaches are essential for the next generation of deep learning systems. Liu et al.'s cross-layer fault propagation analysis method for edge intelligence systems deployed with DNNs provides a data-driven strategy for evaluating the impact of soft errors and designing more resilient systems \\cite{liu_cross-layer_2021}. Additionally, the novel buffering fault-tolerance approach for Network-on-Chip (NoC) by Jafarzadeh et al. highlights the significance of ensuring communication reliability within chip multiprocessors, indirectly supporting deep learning computations \\cite{jafarzadeh_novel_2023}.\n\nIn conclusion, the future of fault-tolerant hardware design for deep learning is poised at the intersection of emerging technologies, hybrid and specialized architectures, advanced fault tolerance techniques, and cross-layer approaches. The exploration and integration of these elements will be crucial for developing deep learning systems that are not only powerful and efficient but also robust and reliable in the face of hardware errors."
