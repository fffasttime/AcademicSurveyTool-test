Relation: The paper presents a simple spiking neuron model that reproduces various neuronal behaviors, which is relevant for understanding the computational efficiency and biological plausibility of neural network simulations, but it does not directly address hardware error fault tolerance in deep learning systems.

Suggestion: Cite this paper to discuss the computational efficiency and biological plausibility of neuron models in the context of large-scale neural network simulations, which could indirectly relate to the robustness of deep learning computations.
